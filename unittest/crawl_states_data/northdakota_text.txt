Solar, Geothermal, Hydrogen & Hydro Power

















Garrison Dam on Lake Sakakawea is a hydroelectric facility producing a capacity of 583 megawatts.







North Dakota has invested in research for hydrogen, solar and geothermal applications. This includes $2.5 million for a Centers of Excellence project at the Energy & Environmental Research Center’s National Center for Hydrogen Technology, which is attracting hydrogen-based business to the state; funding for research at University of North Dakota for commercial application of geothermal; and funding for solar energy research at North Dakota State University.


Solar, Geothermal, Hydrogen & Hydro Power in North Dakota

Several electric cooperatives offer a program to help ranchers install solar powered stock pond watering pumps in rural areas where it is uneconomical to construct electric transmission lines. As an example, Verendrye Electric Cooperative has provided support for over 300 solar pumps and avoided building about 300 miles of distribution line at a savings of about $30,000 per mile.
The Geothermal Laboratory at the University of North Dakota is conducting a geothermal power demonstration project in North Dakota in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy, Continental Resources, Inc., Slope Electric Cooperative and Access Energy, LLC. The objective of the project is to demonstrate and test the technical and economic feasibility of generating electricity from non-conventional, low-temperature geothermal resources using Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology.
The Garrison Dam, on the Missouri River with a capacity of 583 megawatts, is North Dakota’s fifth largest plant in electricity generation capacity.

At this Grand Forks golf course, golfers will soon be able to have their food and drinks delivered via drone




Post Date: Sep 13 2018








GRAND FORKS — Golfers at the pristine King’s Walk golf course in Grand Forks will soon have the choice of ordering food and beverages and having it delivered via drone on the golf course.



Flytrex, an Israeli drone logistics company, announced a partnership Wednesday, Sept. 5, with King’s Walk and Ease Drones to begin a four-to-six-week trial of the food delivery system, which is anticipated to debut Saturday, Sept. 15.

How it works is golfers will first download a custom-built Flytrex mobile app designed for users to place an order for food and beverages at the nearby Eagle’s Crest Bar & Grill. The food, which can vary from grilled hamburgers to cold sandwiches, along with any beverages, will then be loaded into the drone where a staff member then presses a button to deploy the cloud-connected drone. The order is then lowered down via a tethered wire and delivered to designated drop-off points on the golf course using geofencing technology.

APUC Awards Funding Totaling $143,795




Post Date: Nov 27 2018







Bismarck, N.D. -- The North Dakota Agricultural Products Utilization Commission (APUC) awarded funding requests for five projects totaling $143,795 at its quarterly meeting Nov. 15 in Grand Forks.

APUC is a North Dakota Department of Commerce program that administers grant programs for research and development of new and expanded uses for North Dakota agricultural products. The grants can be used for basic and applied research, marketing and utilization, farm diversification, nature-based agritourism, prototype and technology and technical assistance.

The following requests were approved:

Maple River Winery (Casselton) was awarded $21,000 for a marketing project aimed at holiday pop-up markets. The plan focuses on Pride of Dakota companies, who are developing a local retail venue during the holidays. Contact Greg Kempel at 701-347-5900.

NDSU - Coatings and Polymeric Materials (Fargo) was awarded $36,590 to develop a nanotechnology-powered, chemical formulation platform known as “NANOscale Neosomic Dispersion.” Nano-NDs can be used to prepare water-borne formulations of a broad spectrum of active agents with poor water-solubility and stability. Contact Mohiuddin Quadir at 701-231-9563.

NDSU Department of Plant Sciences (Fargo) was awarded $28,480 to determine the biological activity of Emmer, which will be highly relevant in promoting its health benefits to general consumers and promoting it as a “super grain.” Contact Senay Simsek at 701-231-8186.

NDSU Williston Research Center (Williston) was awarded $13,374 to research a new perennial crop that can be harvested as a high-value grain and cut for high-quality forage in the same year. Contact Clair Keene at 701-774-4315.

Rivers Edge Energy (Trenton) was awarded $44,351 to market a new 25 million-gallon ethanol facility in Trenton. The plant will be built on the Yellowstone Energy site near Trenton, with access to BNSF for railing ethanol to West Coast markets. Contact Ken Kjos at 701-572-3530.

APUC is an office within Economic Development and Finance, a division of the North Dakota Department of Commerce. For additional program information please visit North Dakota APUC at www.NDAPUC.com.

Workforce and Education







North Dakota offers a one-stop administrator of all workforce training programs and financial assistance through Job Service North Dakota. Job Service can provide a customized proposal outlining the state and federal programs and dollar amounts available for any project based on the number and title of occupations and their corresponding wage rate.

North Dakota offers two-unique programs that contribute to job training proposals:
 
Workforce 20/20
Workforce 20/20 assists North Dakota employers with implementing new technologies and work methods. This fund helps employers provide retraining and upgrading of employee knowledge and skills.
 
New Jobs Training
New Jobs Training is an innovative program created by Job Service North Dakota to financially assist new or expanding primary sector businesses with filling hourly job positions. The training costs under this program are paid for in whole or in part with income tax withheld from new employees. Funded projects must emphasize job and basic skills training. Funds are available regardless of the company's size. The direct cost of employee training can be reimbursed under the Workforce 20/20 program. Costs can include instructor wages, tuition and registration fees, curriculum development and leasing of training equipment.

Job Service also provides assistance to companies with employee recruitment and testing services. In addition, education and training resources offered through the North Dakota University System are considered for job training assistance. This ranges from facility use to company-specific degree programs.

Employee Turnover Rates
Nationwide, employee turnover rates of 20-30 percent are often an expected cost of doing business.

Employee Absentee Rates
North Dakotans' are known for their work ethic and that is reflected in low absenteeism rates from high school straight through to professional careers and trades. Business benefits from our reliable, dedicated workforce. Many North Dakota businesses don't even consider absenteeism as a cost of doing business.

Oil

















North Dakota is the second largest oil producing state in the U.S., after Texas. The average well produces about 72 barrels of oil per day.







North Dakota’s oil industry generates more than $12 billion of economic activity and supports 35,000 direct workers and more than 65,000 indirect jobs across all sectors of the economy. The necessary job skills continue to broaden as industry moves from the exploration phase towards the development phase.
As more new wells begin producing, more technical, permanent jobs will result. The average annual wage for an oil industry employee in North Dakota in 2011 was approximately $89,020, which is 117.5 percent above the statewide average wage of $40,914.





Oil in North Dakota

North Dakota is the second largest oil producing state in the U.S.
In 2011, North Dakota produced 153 million barrels of oil, a 35 percent increase over 2010 and a 233 percent increase over 2007.
In May 2012, there were 8,000 wells producing 639,000 barrels of oil per day. The average well produced approximately 72 barrels of oil per day.
The oil and gas industry reported $3.556 billion in taxable sales and purchases in 2011, and $1,296.1 million in oil extraction and gross production tax revenues.
In 2011, the oil industry paid $134 million in royalties and lease bonuses to the North Dakota Lands and Minerals Trust Fund. An additional $212 million of royalties, bonuses and oil extraction tax revenues were received by the Common Schools Trust Fund and the other 12 permanent trust funds managed for the North Dakota Board of University and School Lands.
Oil production on the Three Affiliated Tribes has grown from virtually zero production in 2007 to nearly 108,000 barrels of oil per day in 2012. In April 2012, there were 616 wells producing representing 20 percent of the state’s daily oil production.

Minority Certification



















Minority Certification







Disadvantaged business enterprises are afforded special consideration for contracts awarded by certain state and federal agencies. It may also be advantageous for private businesses to subcontract with minority-owned entities. For these reasons, it is important that women-owned, Native American-owned and other minority-owned businesses acquire proof of their minority status.

The North Dakota Department of Transportation reviews applications for certification under the U.S. Department of Transportation's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program as found in 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 26. This includes minority, women, and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals whose businesses relate to some facet of the transportation industry, and is applicable to metropolitan planning organizations, transit organizations, highways, and airports.

Natural Resources







North Dakota is home to abundant natural resources and can offer power to business at rates well below the national average. For information about North Dakota's natural resources or to have business development team answer specific questions regarding your project, contact us at 1-866-4Dakota or email commerce@nd.gov.

 


Water Irrigation
North Dakota can deliver water through its rivers, natural underground aquifers and lakes such as Sakakawea, America's largest man-made reservoir. Many of these surface and ground water supplies are undeveloped and ready for use by new and existing businesses. In addition, North Dakota is home to Garrison Dam, a hydroelectric power generation facility.

The continuing development of North Dakota's agriculture and corresponding food processing industry has had a direct effect on irrigation acres. North Dakota has grown irrigated acres from about 190,000 in 1990 to over 245,000 acres in 2002. While this is a significant increase, it only scratches the surface of our irrigation potential.

Agriculture
North Dakota's greatest natural resource is its soil, with some of the richest farmland lying in the Red River Valley along the state's eastern border. While the state is diversifying its economy in several targeted industries, agriculture remains a vital part of North Dakota.


Learn more about North Dakota's top agricultural commodities according to USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service.


For food processors, the North Dakota Department of Commerce has the ability to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map agriculture commodity production. Commerce includes regional data, transportation infrastructure, utilities and water, and other data factors to provide a powerful tool for your site selection decision.

Wind
North Dakota has an outstanding wind resource - providing more available wind for development than any other state.

Wind Resources and Monitoring Stations


North Dakota offers the following state tax incentives for wind energy:

Income tax credit of three percent for five years,
Property tax exemption for five years,
Sales tax exemption through January 2011 for 100kW turbines and larger
Property tax reduction of three percent of the assessed value, rather than 10 percent).


DMI, the fourth largest producer of wind towers in North America, and LM Glasfiber are both located in North Dakota. LM Glasfiber is a Danish company that is the market's leading supplier of wind turbine blades and the preferred global business partner for wind turbine manufacturers and end-users.
 


Petroleum
North Dakota is a substantial crude oil-producing State with an output typically equal to roughly 2.7 percent of total annual U.S. production. The state is also an entrance point for Canadian crude oil transported via pipeline to U.S. Midwest refining markets. A petroleum refinery in Mandan refines crude oil extracted from the Williston Basin, which covers eastern Montana and the western Dakotas, as well as a small amount of Canadian crude. The refinery produces transportation fuels primarily for the northern Great Plains States and the Twin Cities area.

Ethanol is produced at ethanol plants in North Dakota, giving the state considerable ethanol production capacity. North Dakota is a moderate consumer of ethanol in blended motor gasoline.






 


Natural Gas & Electricity
North Dakota typically produces roughly 1 percent of the nation's annual natural gas production. The majority of the state's supply is transported via major pipelines originating in Montana and western Canada on their way to U.S. Midwest consumption markets. North Dakota has the distinction of being one of only two States that produce synthetic natural gas. The single largest source of synthetic gas in the United States is the Great Plains Synfuels Plant in Beulah, North Dakota, which annually produces more than 54 billion cubic feet of gas from coal

Electricity generation and demand are both low in North Dakota, commensurate with the state's population. Coal-fired plants provide nearly all of North Dakota's electricity generation. Most of the coal used for power generation is supplied by several large surface mines in the central part of the state. State coal production is substantial, and North Dakota brings in only small amounts of coal from other states. Hydroelectric dams account for most of the state's non-coal-generated electricity.

Public Finance Authority







The North Dakota Public Finance Authority offers many financing programs and options to new and growing businesses.
Industrial Development Bond Program
Under its Industrial Development Bond Program (IDB), the Authority makes loans to manufacturers that qualify as small issue manufacturers. Qualified small issue manufacturers are defined within the Internal Revenue Code as "Any facility which is used in the manufacturing or production of tangible personal property including the process resulting in a change in the condition of such property." Within that definition, the qualifying organizations must also meet a capital spending requirement. As part of the legislation that approved the IDB, the Authority is limited to $2,000,000 per project.

The interest rates paid by a qualifying manufacturer are market rates which are set through a competitive bid process when the Authority issues and sells its program bonds to fund the loan. The interest rates paid by the Authority on its program bonds are the same rates the manufacturer will pay on its loan to the Authority. For manufacturers that qualify, the IDB provides an opportunity to finance fixed assets (buildings and equipment) with tax-exempt long-term fixed rates.

The IDB has been assigned a rating of "A+" by Standard & Poors Rating Group.

For more information on these programs, contact the ND Public Finance Authority via email or call 701-328-7100.

Labor Costs
North Dakota companies report significant savings in labor costs as a result of extremely low absenteeism and turnover rates.  This creates business savings in recruitment, replacement and re-training.

To review labor costs for North Dakota, visit the Bureau of Labor Statistics or Job Service North Dakota for Businesses.

 


Taxes
As a result of North Dakota's tax incentives, our state is ranked as one of the lowest tax states in the nation.  Our tax rates also reflect the state's desire to continue that reputation.

CORPORATE INCOME TAX

Graduated rate of 1.41% to 4.31% applies:


Over $0, but not over $25,000  = 1.41% of taxable income
Over $25,000, but not over $50,000  =  $352 + 3.55% of the amount over $25,000
Over $50,000  =  $1,240 + 4.31% of the amount over $50,000

 
The state has traditionally used an equally-weighted, three-factor apportionment formula consisting of property, payroll, and sales.  Beginning in the 2016 tax year, North Dakota is phasing in the allowance of a single sales factor apportionment formula for purposes of computing income tax using the following phase-in election schedule:
 

Tax Years 2016 and 2017:  Sales – 50%, Property – 25%, and Payroll – 25%
Tax Year 2018:  Sales – 75%, Property – 12½%, and Payroll – 12½%
Tax Year 2019 and following years:  Sales – 100%

 
Once the election is made, it is binding for the following five tax years. A taxpayer may then make an election to continue using the sales-only apportionment formula. If a taxpayer fails to renew this election, the taxpayer will be required to go back to using the equally-weighted three-factor apportionment formula for the following three tax years, after which an election to use the alternative apportionment formula may be made again.

PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX

For the most part, personal property is exempt from property tax in North Dakota. Personal property of utilities companies that are assessed by the State Board of Equalization is subject to property tax. Household personal property, inventories, and machinery and equipment used in trade or manufacturing are exempt from property taxes. Machinery and equipment used in refining products from oil or gas extracted from the earth is deemed to be real property and therefore subject to property taxes. A mobile home used as a residence or place of business is also subject to a property tax.

PROPERTY TAX
Determined by multiplying the taxable value of real property -- land and buildings -- by the local mill rate. North Dakota commercial property tax is calculated by multiplying true and full value of commercial property, which the local assessor establishes, by 50 percent to reach assessed value; then multiplying assessed value by 10 percent to reach taxable value; and then multiplying taxable value by the local mill rate.
 
Example (for reference only):



Market Value
 
Assessed Value
 
Taxable Value
Mill Levy Rate
Property Tax


$1,000,000
x 50%
= $500,000
x 10%
= $50,000
x .31732
= $15,866




In the 2016 Tax Foundation ranking for property tax, North Dakota ranked third best among states.*
The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy evaluated the commercial property tax for the largest city in each state in 2015. 
	
They calculated for the effective tax rate for a $1-million valued commercial property with $200k in fixtures.  The results of the study placed Fargo, ND, at 46th lowest out of 53 with an effective tax rate of 1.14%.
They did the same with industrial property using a $1-million valued property plus $1 million in personal property.  This time Fargo was ranked 49th with an effective rate of 0.68.

Unemployment Rates
2017 Unemployment Insurance Tax Rate Schedule

Non-Construction: 2.34 percent (maximum wage cap 2017 - $35,100)
New Employers are: Non-Construction covered after June 30, 2015

When employers become liable for unemployment insurance, they are classified as "new employers" and are assigned a new employer rate. Tax rates are determined for each calendar year based on the employer's history as of the preceding October.

If prior to October, then "non-construction" employers have at least six quarters of coverage and they are classified as "experience-rated employers" beginning that calendar year. Otherwise they continue as "new employers." Experience-rated employers are assigned rates based on their record of unemployment insurance taxes paid and benefits charged.

The rates vary each year depending on the employer's individual history and the condition of the state's unemployment compensation trust fund. The maximum amount of each worker's wages subject to taxation each year is 70 percent of the statewide average annual payroll.
 


Workers' Compensation Rates
The state office for Workforce Safety and Insurance, is the sole provider and administrator of worker's compensation coverage in North Dakota. Insurance is financed entirely through employer premiums. A company's premium is determined by applying the rate for a job classification to the amount of taxable payroll in that classification.

The maximum taxable payroll for each employee is capped at 70 percent of the state's average annual wage. The current cap is $35,100 (July 1, 2017). Companies may also be eligible for discounts on their premium based on the company's "experience rating" or approved safety incentive program participation.

Ethanol

















Ethanol contributes more than $300 million to North Dakota's economy and employs more than 10,000. 
						 







The ethanol industry contributes more than $300 million annually to the state’s economy and supports more than 10,000 jobs. North Dakota’s ethanol plants employ nearly 200 workers directly in positions such as chemists, engineers, accountants, managers and support staff. The average annual wage for an ethanol plant employee in North Dakota is approximately $64,000.

Ethanol in North Dakota

North Dakota’s ethanol industry has the capacity to produce: (1)400 million gallons of ethanol, more than 10 times the amount produced in 2005. (2) 1.3 million tons of dry distillers grains, a high-value livestock feed. (3) 6 million gallons of corn oil, used in the biodiesel industry.
Each North Dakota ethanol plant is located in a community with a population of less than 2,500 and contributes an average of 49 jobs and an average annual payroll of $3.3 million to the community.
North Dakota ethanol plants use approximately 140 million bushels of corn annually with more than 80 percent of the corn purchased from North Dakota farmers. Forty to sixty percent of North Dakota’s total corn production annually is purchased by North Dakota ethanol plants.
Approximately six percent (24 million gallons) of the 400 million gallons of ethanol produced annually in North Dakota is blended with gasoline and sold within the state.
North Dakota is a national leader in the establishment of flex fuel pumps. As of June 2012, the state has 223 ethanol flex fuel pumps applied for or installed in 46 communities. The state also has 65,000 flex fuel vehicles, a 55 percent increase since 2010.
A biorefinery is under development near Jamestown, North Dakota. The development will occur in two phases with Phase I consisting of a 65-million gallon per year conventional dry mill ethanol plant and Phase II adding a 10-million gallon per year cellulosic bolt-on facility.

Petroleum Marketing







North Dakota petroleum marketers are dedicated to providing quality product, great customer service and continue to be community supporters. Consumer demand always has and always will dictate what a petroleum retailer offers at the pump.

The unprecedented economic growth in the state has been very good for the retail petroleum industry. One of the major challenges amidst the prosperity has been finding adequate supplies of diesel fuel and workforce, and these concerns have increased with continued oil development. Over 500 million gallons of diesel fuel are being used annual in oil activity, in comparison to annual consumption across the state of 1 billion.


Petroleum Marketing in North Dakota

There are roughly 500 petroleum marketers in North Dakota. These operations deal in every aspect of refined petroleum and renewable fuel products ranging from wholesale and supply to the numerous retail outlets scattered across the state.
In 2011, retail petroleum dealers sold about 750 million gallons of taxable gasoline in the state as well as close to one billion gallons of taxable diesel fuel. This figure does not take into account the 325 million gallons of diesel fuel sold for non-highway use vital to agricultural, industrial and energy sectors within the state.
North Dakota petroleum marketers continue to support research and development of renewable fuels as viable sources of alternate energy. Over the course of the last four years, nearly 200 ethanol blender pumps have been installed across the state. About 55 percent of all gasoline sold in the state now contains some blend of ethanol.

Wind

















North Dakota is ranked in the top 10 for greatest wind capacity. Wind towers can be found across the state producing electricity.







Over the last few years many of the region’s utilities completed construction of wind facilities to comply either with renewable portfolio standards in states surrounding North Dakota or to meet internal policies related to diverse energy portfolio standards. During the last year, however, the wind industry in North Dakota found itself in a state of transition. Driven in part by the economic slowdown caused by the 2008 recession and the resulting decrease in demand for electricity, the construction of new facilities also slowed down, with several projects stalled.

Adding to the challenges for the industry was the failure of Congress to extend the production tax credit beyond December 2012. In spite of these issues, the capacity of the wind industry grew during the last year.

Highlights include:

Since 2010, the North Dakota Public Service Commission has approved wind projects with total investments estimated at $930 million.
In the last two years, installed wind capacity in the state has grown by over 250 megawatts with an additional 210 megawatts under construction in early 2012.
North Dakota ranked tenth in the nation in capacity in 2012. The North Dakota Public Service Commission has permitted 2,900 megawatts of wind generation.

Development Fund Awards Funding Totaling $440,000




Post Date: Mar 26 2019







Bismarck, N.D. -- The North Dakota Development Fund, a funding program within the North Dakota Department of Commerce, awarded funding for four projects totaling $440,000 at its board meeting in February.
 
The North Dakota Development Fund was created in 1991 as an economic development tool. It provides flexible funding through debt and equity investments for new or expanding North Dakota primary sector businesses. The fund also manages a daycare loan program created by the North Dakota Legislation in 2009.
 
The following requests were funded:
 
Skid-Lift, Inc. (Fargo) was awarded a $40,000 loan to assist with working capital needs. The company manufactures a scissor lift compatible with a skid-steer to utilize the functionality of the skid-steer to move and power the lift.
 
RJ Energy Solutions, LLC (Fargo) was awarded a $150,000 loan to assist in funding equipment purchases and working capital to help cover the costs of the company’s expansion. The company provides predictive on-line monitoring for restaurants and other related businesses.
 
TSR Parts, Inc. (Colgate) was awarded a renewal of a $150,000 revolving line of credit to assist in funding inventory and receivables. The company manufactures replacement straw choppers for all models of combines.
 
Auto Pilot Medical Technologies, Inc. - WalkWise (Fargo) was awarded a $100,000 convertible promissory note as an investment to help fund product development, sales efforts and capital costs for the production of WalkWise units. The company manufactures a health tracking system for those using a walker to assist with everyday motion.
 
The North Dakota Department of Commerce works to improve the quality of life for North Dakota citizens by leading efforts to attract, retain and expand wealth. Commerce serves businesses and communities statewide through committed people and partners who offer valuable programs and dynamic services.

Financing is the focus of the Bank of North Dakota efforts to stimulate economic development in the state for both business and agricultural lending services. It offers a variety of programs in each area. Use the links below to explore financing options in both areas.

Business Financing Services
Beginning Entrepreneur Loan Guarantee Program
This program is designed to assist in business start-up financing by providing a financial institution with an 85% guaranty of a loan not to exceed $100,000.

Biofuels PACE
Biofuels PACE (Biofuels Partnership in Assisting Community Expansion) was established to buy down the interest rate on loans to biodiesel and ethanol production facilities, and livestock operations.

Business Development Loan Program
The Business Development Loan Program is designed to assist new and existing businesses in obtaining loans that would have a higher degree of risk than would normally be acceptable to a lending institution. The total outstanding amount under this program by BND may not exceed $25 million.

Commercial Bank Participation Program
Commercial Bank Participation Program is founded on principles that all loans should serve legitimate credit needs of the State and be made on a sound and collectible basis. BND will consider a broad range of loan applications. Specific equity requirements have not been established. Each loan will be reviewed on its own merits. Adequate collateral will generally be required to protect the interest of BND.

Flex PACE Program
Flex PACE was designed to provide interest buy down to non-PACE qualifying businesses where the Community determines eligibility and accountability standards. Flex PACE targets essential community businesses without the job creation requirement.

 

Agricultural Financing Services
Agriculture Partnership in Assisting Community Expansion (Ag PACE)
This program has been established to buy down the interest rate on loans to farmers who are investing in other nontraditional agriculture activities to supplement farm income.

Beginning Farmer Farm Loans (Revolving Loan Fund)
The Beginning Farmer Loan Programs assist the farmer and rancher in the first time purchase of farm real estate and/or the purchase of equipment and livestock. Each qualified applicant is eligible for a $250,000 loan from the Real Estate Loan Program and $250,000 loan from the Chattel Loan Program.

Biofuels PACE
Biofuels PACE (Biofuels Partnership in Assisting Community Expansion) was established to buy down the interest rate on loans to biodiesel and ethanol production facilities, and livestock operations.

Established Farmer Real Estate Loan Program
The Established Farmer Real Estate Loan Program assists the farmer and rancher with agricultural real estate loans. The Bank may make direct loans to farmers for agricultural purposes. The borrower must be a North Dakota resident.

Family Farm Loan Program
The North Dakota legislature has developed a program to help family farms. This program allows BND to participate in loans for qualified purposes up to 90% of the loan amount.

Farm and Ranch Participation Program
This program follows the principles of BND's participation loan program, that all loans should: 1) Serve the legitimate credit needs of the State; and 2) Be made on a sound and collectible basis. The total loans and extensions outstanding at any one time to a single borrower may not exceed 15% of BND's total capital. All loans are reviewed in accordance with BND's lending policies and sound banking practices including, but not limited to, the intended purpose of the loan, the ability to repay, the operation and its management and the feasibility of the project.

Farm Operating Loan Program
The North Dakota legislature has established a loan program to assist with farm operating loans. The Bank may participate in farm operating loans with the minimum requirements for eligibility as a "farmer".

Farm Real Estate Loan Guarantee Program
This program is designed to assist farmers with the purchase or the restructuring of agricultural real estate loans by providing a financial institution with a 75% guarantee of total loans that do not exceed $400,000 to an individual borrower. The Bank may guarantee loans for the purchase of agricultural real estate or the restructuring of agricultural real estate loans to North Dakota residents by banks, credit unions, lending associations that are part of the farm credit system, and savings and loan associations in the state of North Dakota.

First Time Farmer Finance Program
The North Dakota First Time Farmer Finance program (NDFTFFP) is a tax-exempt bond program designed to assist First Time Farmers in the state of North Dakota to acquire agricultural property at lower interest rates. The Bank of North Dakota (BND), acting as the Farm Finance Agency, determines the eligibility of the applicant and also approves and issues the bond. The bond will then be assigned to a Bond Purchaser which typically is a financial institution or contract holder. Since the interest received by the Bond Purchaser is exempt from state and federal tax, the interest rate to the First Time Farmer is at a lower rate.

Flex PACE Program
Flex PACE was designed to provide interest buy down to non-PACE qualifying businesses where the Community determines eligibility and accountability standards. Flex PACE targets essential community businesses without the job creation requirement.

Government Guaranteed Loan Purchase Program
The Government Guaranteed Loan Purchase Program (FSA or Rural Development) has been designed at BND to provide interest rate assistance to borrowers that are experiencing cash flow difficulties. The Bank may purchase the guaranteed portion of a term loan guaranteed by the Farm Service Agency, Rural Development, or Small Business Administration.

Livestock Waste Management System Loan Program
The primary purpose of this program is to reduce and/or prevent water quality impacts associated with livestock waste by providing low interest financial assistance to livestock producers for installing waste management facilities. Eligibility will be determined by approval of applications by the North Dakota Department of Health.

Partnership in Assisting Community Expansion (PACE)
One of the most attractive programs is the Partnership in Assisting Community Expansion (PACE) fund, an interest buy down loan program that is available to primary sector business including manufacturing, data processing, communications, telecommunications and targeted service industries.

The PACE Fund is designed to assist North Dakota communities in expanding their economic base by providing for new job development. The PACE Program is available to finance the purchase of equipment or real estate, as well as term working capital. In conjunction with community support, the program provides an interest buy down that can reduce the borrower's overall interest rate.

Value-Added Agriculture Equity Loan Program (ENVEST)
The ENVEST Program provides a below market interest rate for North Dakota farmers and businessmen to purchase shares in start up or expanding agricultural processing facilities.

MATCH Program
The MATCH program is designed to encourage and attract financially strong companies, "A" rated or equivalent. Loan funds may be used to finance real estate, machinery and equipment, and for the purchase or lease of equipment. The program targets manufacturing, processing and value-added industries.

New Venture Capital Fund
Administered by the North Dakota Development Fund, the New Venture Capital Program is an innovative financial program that provides flexible financing through debt and equity investments for new or expanding businesses in the state of North Dakota.

Quality of Life



















Quality of Life

















North Dakota is consistently ranked as a best place to live and offers families an excellent quality of life.







Clean air, abundant recreational opportunities, good education system and family-friendly communities help make North Dakota a great place to live, work, play and do business.
 
 
Affordable Housing & Healthcare
North Dakota's home cost is favorable compared to the nation. According to Sperling's Best Places, the median home cost in North Dakota is $150,600; this compares with the U.S. median home cost of $217,200.

Competitive, high-quality health care is readily available in North Dakota and we know how important it is to have an ample supply of qualified staff to fully care for patients. In 2008, North Dakota ranked in the top 10 Healthy States by CQ Press, which uses factors such as percentage of immunized children, seat belt usage, and percentage of population covered by health care insurance, among others to determine rankings.

 


Family Friendly Neighborhoods
North Dakota is a place to feel safe and has consistently been named in the top 5 for safest states by CQ Press. Everyday living is less stressful in towns and communities that are safe. Parents bring their children here because they want them to grow up without fear in a place where it's safe to play in their own backyards.

Consider this: North Dakotans don't lose valuable time commuting to and from work. The average commute time in North Dakota is about 18 minutes, nationally it's 27 minutes. Short commute times translate into reduced stress levels. Businesses also benefit; employees with less stress make for a more productive and content workforce.
 
 


Quality Environment
North Dakota is one of a handful of states to meet all National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Such standards are established by the Environmental Protection Agency to protect the health and welfare of all citizens. North Dakota was one of the first states to reach "attainment" status for all criteria pollutants. The state has remained in compliance since the standards were first established in the 1970s.

The water in North Dakota is among the purest in the nation. Pure, clean water is important for a place like North Dakota, where people enjoy the outdoors during each of our four seasons. We value the air, earth and water responsible for good crops, a clean environment and a healthy lifestyle.
 
 


Recreational Activities
North Dakota is an impressive state with rolling prairies, majestic badlands and abundant wildlife. It's also a state with exciting cities, excellent fine dining, great places to stay and casino nightlife. Water parks, amusement parks and state parks offer endless entertainment for families and the young-at-heart.

A day trip from anywhere in North Dakota will show you that North Dakota is a great place to live, work and play. Use the below to find out more about the abundant indoor and outdoor opportunities available in North Dakota:

Application Process







Qualified projects greater than $150,000 are presented to the Development Fund Board of Directors for consideration. Requests for loans or equity investments less than $150,000 can be improved internally by the funds staff. Those projects are then reviewed by the board of directors at a following board meeting. (Dollar limits are cumulative and include existing advances in determining the approval process.) The Development Fund Board of Directors hold regular meetings depending on the number of projects that need to be presented on the 2nd and 4th Thursday of each month or teleconferences can also be used when necessary. 

To determine whether or not your project is eligible, you must contact your local financial institution, a local economic development office or the ND Development Fund staff. We recommend an early meeting between investors, entrepreneurs, community developers and other appropriate team players.

After you've submitted sufficient information to determine the merits of your request, the Fund requires a 15-20 day lead time to conduct due diligence and complete other details needed to process debt and equity requests.

After board review, applicants receive written notice of approval or denial. Once you accept the commitment letter and provide necessary documents, closing takes place. This process usually takes 15-30 days.

For applications and other forms, please visit the NDDF Forms page.

Northern Plains UAS Test Site



















Northern Plains UAS Test Site























 










North Dakota's Northern Plains UAS Test Site is one of seven FAA-approved UAS test sites.

The test sites conduct crucial research to determine how to safely integrate UAS into the national airspace. The Northern Plains UAS Test Site was the first FAA test site to conduct flights, launching its first research flight in early May 2014.


The Northern Plains UAS Test Site is headquartered in Grand Forks, ND. 

Northern Plains Unmanned Systems Authority
North Dakota has created the Northern Plains Unmanned Systems Authority, a six-member commission assembled to help advance North Dakota's UAS opportunities and to provide oversight for the Northern Plains UAS Test Site. The authority is chaired by Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford and includes representatives from the state's general aviation industry, University of North Dakota Aerospace, North Dakota Aeronautics Commission, North Dakota Department of Commerce and the Office of the Adjutant General.

 











Nick Flom







Nicholas Flom is the Executive Director for the Northern Plains Unmanned Aircraft Systems Test Site, an organization designated by the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct critical research into the certification and operational requirements necessary to safely integrate UAS into the national airspace system.

Incentive Certification Forms



















Incentive Certification Forms














Primary Sector Certification
Most of the state's economic development tools and incentives are targeted toward primary sector businesses. In fact, legislation for several of these incentives specifies that a business must be 'certified' as a primary sector business by the director of the Economic Development & Finance Division of the North Dakota Department of Commerce. Certification does not guarantee receipt of any incentive, but being certified as a primary sector business can be an important first step in the process.








Primary Sector Certification



                    File Size: 411 kb 
                








"Primary sector business" means an individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or association certified by the department of commerce division of economic development and finance which through the employment of knowledge or labor adds value to a product, process, or service which results in the creation of new wealth.
 
“New wealth” means revenues generated by a business in this state through the sale of products or services to:

Customers outside of this state; or
Customers in this state if the products or services were previously unavailable or difficult to obtain from a business in this state.

"Production agriculture” means the production of crops and livestock on or near a farm as part of the regular farm enterprise directed by a farm operator and the farm operator’s partners.  The term does not include an investor-owned livestock feeding or milking operation located apart from a farm headquarters which is managed by employees.

Programs and incentives that may require certification include:


New Jobs Training


Research and Development Company Certification to
	Sell, Transfer or Assign Unused Tax Credit


Sales Tax Exemption on Computer and Telecommunications Equipment


Seed Capital Investment Tax Credit


 









Research & Development Company Certification



                    File Size: 49 kb 
                








A business must be certified as a "qualified research and development company" before a taxpayer can elect to sell, transfer, or assign all or part of its unused Research and Experimental Expenditure Tax Credit.
 









Seed Capital Investment Tax Credit



                    File Size: 131 kb 
                








A taxpayer is entitled to a credit against state income tax liability if they make a qualified investment in a "qualified business" for the Seed Capital Tax Credit.
 









Agricultural Business Investment Tax Credit



                    File Size: 50 kb 
                








A taxpayer is entitled to a credit against state income tax liability if there is a qualified investment in a "qualified business" for the Agricultural Business Tax Credit.
 









Angel Fund Certification 



                    File Size: 180 kb 
                








To be eligible for the Angel Investor Tax Credit, an angel fund must be certified by the North Dakota Department of Commerce. Criteria for certification can be found in the certification form, as well as in N.D.C.C. 57-38-01.26 at http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t57c38.pdf#nameddest=57-38-01p26.  

Effective July 1, 2017, angel funds must meet new conditions to become certified and for investors to receive the Angel Investor Tax Credit against their income tax liability.  Applications for certification must be approved prior to a fund investing in a qualified business for which investors intend to submit claims for a tax credit.

Qualified Business for Angel Investor Tax Credit



                    File Size: 177 kb 
                








Recent legislative changes also include criteria for investments into an in-state or out-of-state “qualified business”. These businesses must  be certified by the North Dakota Department of Commerce prior to receiving investment dollars from a certified angel fund.









Safe-Harbor Application for a Life Science Animal-Use Certified Company



                    File Size: 56 kb 
                








Use this form only for application for a life science animal-use certified company in the state of North Dakota by the North Dakota Department of Commerce Division of Economic Development and Finance as defined in N.D.C.C. 54-34.3-16. 
 









Technology-Based Entrepreneurship Certification



                    File Size: 130 kb 
                








Certification as an entrepreneurial center provides access to the Technology-based Entrepreneurship Grant Program, administered by the North Dakota Department of Commerce. Certification as an entrepreneurial center does not guarantee funding. An entity already certified as an entrepreneurial center for the New Venture Capital Program is already eligible for the Technology-based Entrepreneurship Grant Program and does not need to submit again."

The EmPower North Dakota Commission strives to advance all energy sectors in North Dakota.







In 2007, the North Dakota Legislature formalized energy policy and created the 16-member EmPower Commission.  This group is charged with developing comprehensive energy policy recommendations for the state's diverse and growing energy industry. The commission is made up of representatives from all the state's energy industries and is a model of how differing interests can come together for the good of an industry.
 
The EmPower Commission released a policy update and recommendation report in July 2016. This report is available below and provides the basis for possible legislation to continue to support the energy industry in North Dakota.

Development Fund



















Business in need of equity financing can look to the Development Fund as a possible solution. 







The North Dakota Development Fund coordinates efforts between all the sources of financing, the business and the community. Any project considered for this financing must be feasible and have a reasonable chance of succeeding.

The fund provides "flexible financing" through loans and equity investments not available from most conventional lenders and is available to any primary-sector business with the exception of production agriculture. The Development Fund also administers the Regional Rural Revolving Loan Fund, which provides funding for primary-sector projects located in a community of less than 8,000 in population or located more than five miles outside the city limits. 

The fund is a source of financing whose funds can be subordinated to a companies lead lender. If a business can't handle added debt, the Development Fund can take an equity financing position.




 







Primary Sector Business
Primary sector includes individuals and businesses which, through the employment of knowledge or labor, add value to a product, process, or service that results in the creation of new wealth. Primary sector includes tourism and specific types of investor-owned agriculture, and is typically businesses such as manufacturers, food processors or export service companies. Investor-owned agriculture includes livestock feeding or milking operations, or other value added agriculture located apart from an individual farm operation that is professionally managed and has employees.

Tesoro operates a diesel refinery in Mandan, N.D.







Several new refinery projects are being evaluated. They are diesel topping plants of 20,000 barrels per day near Trenton (Dakota Oil Processing) and Dickinson (MDU Resources Group, Inc. and Calumet Specialty Products, LLC) and one of 15,000 barrels per day near Makoti (Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara (MHA) Nation). North Dakota’s only operational facility, the Tesoro Mandan refinery, has increased its crude processing capabilities by approximately 20 percent (60,000 barrels per day to 70,000).


Refining in North Dakota

The additional processing capacity will result in approximately 4,000 barrels per day of additional diesel product volume.
The refinery currently has 254 full time employees and routinely has 50 to 60 contact employees working at the facility each day.
The refinery provides motor fuels product to North Dakota, Montana, South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
The refinery currently processes 100 percent Williston Basin Crude and over 90 percent of the crude processed is from North Dakota wells.

Local Economic Development Programs







Over 30 communities and counties in North Dakota have economic developers. These developers are supported by boards of directors that include community leaders. This means the people your business needs to succeed already understand and support economic development opportunities available to you.

In addition, more than 80 communities have in place a one percent sales tax that can be used as economic development revenue for staffing, marketing, loan programs and other development incentives.

For example, one county paid 80 percent of a maximum-interest buy-down for a company expansion. The city paid the remaining 20 percent for a total of $120,000. This joint effort enabled the bank to provide a $1.25 million loan at an effective interest rate of 1.5 percent.

Agriculture

















Agriculture is still the #1 industry in North Dakota's economy. The state typically leads the nation in over a dozen crops.







Production agriculture is an important part of the North Dakota economy. North Dakota continues to work to diversify its agricultural fabric by targeting the development of value added agriculture.

Definition of Value Added Agriculture

Value added agriculture is changes made to primary agriculture products (crops and livestock) that increase the product's value, thereby creating new economic activity and jobs in one of three ways:

Process activities that create value for the product and/or introduce the product to new markets;
Diversification and/or modification of primary agriculture products; or
Pre-production modifications that increase yields, quality and uses

Value added agriculture is not: on farm production of crops and livestock; biotechnology and research and development activities focused on increasing primary agricultural production; human capital investments; agritourism; seed production; and transportation
 
Focus of Value Added
North Dakota's initial focus in this area is to develop local markets for bio-fuels and its co-products working in cooperation with:

State Agencies
Commodity Groups
Livestock
Bio-energy
New and Emerging crops
Consultants of past projects
Construction companies
Engineering companies
Investors

Biodiesel



















Biodiesel

















The biodiesel industry is still in the defining stages of development in the United States.







Biodiesel is a clean burning alternative fuel produced from renewable domestic resources that can help narrow the energy supply and demand gap. In North Dakota, biodiesel is primarily produced from canola oil feedstock, but can be made from any vegetable oil as well as from animal fats or used frying oils from restaurants and/or food manufacturing plants.

Currently, there is one biodiesel production facility operating in North Dakota, ADM Velva. Limited demand for biodiesel from within the state of North Dakota will limit the possibility of any new production plants in the state.

Biodiesel in North Dakota

North Dakota biodiesel production uses about 65 percent of the states’ canola production, or about 700,000 acres worth of canola.
Minnesota and Canadian mandates are creating a demand pull for North Dakota produced biodiesel.
The ADM Velva plant brings jobs and new tax base into the area.
The North Dakota State Research Center in Minot has been operating a field plot tractor, fueled by B100 canola biodiesel for 8 years with no mechanical issues.
Since the canola biodiesel plant was built, North Dakota canola farmers have enjoyed historically high canola seed prices.
State funding through the Centers of Excellence initiative has fostered a partnership between North Dakota State University and Monsanto to increase acreage and oil content of canola. The release of this new canola line in the near future will expand acreage and yields, increasing the available feedstock for biodiesel production in North Dakota.
Investments in the Renewable Energy Development Fund have enabled the Energy and Environmental Research Center to develop a bio-based diesel with traits identical to petroleum-based diesel. This has enabled the development of a demonstration plant hosted by Tesoro and allows Tesoro to consider placing this renewable fuel directly in its pipeline for export. The Biofuels PACE Program remains available as a financing incentive for new biofuel production facilities in North Dakota.

Technology

















North Dakota's information technology infrastructure helps business and government become more profitable and efficient.







As one of our five targeted industries for growth, North Dakota's technology-based business sector is growing and diversifying.  Keeping pace with rapid changes in the technology arena and integrating those advances benefits all North Dakotans.

North Dakota’s IT industry contributes significantly to the state’s overall growth and economic strength.  It is connected to virtually every industry across the state. According to the Information Technology Council of North Dakota (ITCND) State of the IT Industry 2015 Guide, more than 3,280 businesses employ 21,760 North Dakotans in various fields including IT, human relations, finance and marketing.

Companies like Microsoft and Amazon have long called North Dakota home. They, together with other high-demand IT users like Unisys and Cargill Global Business Services understand the state’s economic landscape and have experienced our great work ethic. 

North Dakota continues to be at the forefront of offering broadband services to even the most rural communities in the state, despite having one of the lowest population densities in the nation. The ND Association of Telephone Cooperatives tells us that more than 95% of the our population has access to broadband services.

North Dakota has the highest percentage of people with access to FTTH (fiber to the home). This status is thought to be attributed to an abundance of rural cooperatives and small telecoms that have worked together to fill the gaps left by larger companies.  In fact there is one corner of the state where 100% of homes and businesses are connected to fiber. Dakota Central Telecommunications (DCT) cooperatives produced This is Living Well, a video about the benefits of the collaboration with Dickey Rural Network (DRN) that created this 10,000 square mile region. 

North Dakota’s broadband leaders have also released a report highlighting investments made to make North Dakota number one in the country for providing high-speed fiber optic access.  Redundancy has been built into every corner of the state’s fiber backbone (see map) providing broadband access to every K-12 school, state agency and hospital in the state.

In October of 2013, ITCND, in cooperation with private and public sector stakeholders launched the Dakota Fiber Initiative (DFI) to ensure that ND remains at the top of the nation in broadband availability, speed and affordability.

State leaders are now working toward providing an even more inviting atmosphere for data centers.  Legislation has been introduced to create a new section to ND Century Code Chapter 57-39.2 to provide a sales tax exemption for enterprise information technology equipment and computer software purchased for use in a qualified data center. See HB 1089.

Lignite

















The lignite industry contributes more than $3 billion to North Dakota's economy. North Dakota is one of the country's top 10-coal producing states.







North Dakota’s lignite industry is an innovative and vital part of the state’s economy with a $3 billion economic impact. The state supports 4,000 megawatts of lignite and other coal generation at seven locations providing low cost, reliable electric power to two million customers in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana and Iowa. North Dakota is one of the country’s top 10 coal-producing states, mining approximately 30 million tons every year since 1988.

Nearly 80 percent of the lignite coal mined annually is used to generate electricity; about 13 percent is used to make synthetic natural gas that is delivered to 400,000 homes and businesses in the eastern United States; and seven percent is used to produce fertilizer products containing anhydrous ammonia and ammonium sulfate.
Lignite in North Dakota

The 99 megawatts Spiritwood Station near Jamestown was commissioned in 2011. Fuel processed through the DryFine© lignite refining system at Great River Energy’s Coal Creek Station was successfully demonstrated at Spiritwood in late 2011. The environmental controls designed in the plant were demonstrated to meet all current and known future regulations. The plant is currently awaiting completion of the adjacent steam host to allow the plant to generate with the economics of a combined heat and power plant as designed.
The Great Plains Synfuels Plant (Synfuels Plant), owned by Dakota Gasification Company (Dakota Gas), is the only commercial-scale coal gasification plant in the U.S. manufacturing natural gas. Average daily production of natural gas is about 153 million cubic feet, the majority of which is used in the eastern United States.
The Synfuels Plant supplies carbon dioxide to the world’s largest carbon capture and storage project in the world in Saskatchewan, Canada, for use in enhanced oil recovery. Dakota Gas currently captures between 2.5 and 3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year.
Dakota Gas exports about 152 million cubic feet per day of CO2 to Canada – about 50 percent of the CO2 produced when running at full rates. As of 2012, Dakota Gas has captured almost 22 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.
Through 2012, more than 22,000 acres of mined land in North Dakota have gone through final bond release, equivalent to about 35 square miles.
A portion of reclaimed land becomes devoted to public use such as Harmony Lake which is now used for hunting, fishing, photography, birding, canoeing, boating, and other outdoor activities.
Basin Electric Power Cooperative’s Glenharold mine received its final bond release in 2012. Over its 30 year productive life the mine won three national awards for its reclamation work.
Currently, the Lignite Research Council is participating in 15 research and development projects worth approximately $170 million. Many of these projects focus on ways to reduce, capture and store CO2.

Energy Efficiency

















Simple energy efficiency techniques like installing additional insulation in your home can have dramatic cost saving impacts on your heating costs.







Energy efficiency continues to be a high priority in public buildings around the state and in North Dakota homes. Over 11,000 energy efficiency and renewable energy rebates were given out to North Dakota residents and businesses resulting in $3.4 million in energy cost savings.


Energy Efficiency in North Dakota 

The Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering Department and NDSU Extension Service provided education and technical assistance on energy efficiency and conservation through programs such as Home Energy 101, home builders educational seminars, 4-H leader training on the importance of home energy, and energy savings opportunities related to grain drying.
Energy conservation efforts helped weatherize almost 3,500 homes for low-income individuals across North Dakota.
North Dakotan’s received 3,800 rebates (at $150 each) for ENERGY STAR refrigerators, and will save approximately 2 million kilowatt hours annually.
Approximately 164 local government buildings across the state have been retrofitted through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant annually saving over $1.1 million.
In 2010, ND Switch launched a statewide effort asking North Dakotans to make small energy use changes that collectively create a big impact. A variety of resources is available at www.NDSwitch.com.
The state building code now encompasses the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code and the International Residential Code energy efficiency requirements.
To date across North Dakota, over 1,130 ground source heat pump systems have been installed in both residential and commercial buildings.

Emerging Teleservices eBusiness Sector
North Dakota has attracted and expanded some of the most recognizable information technology companies in the world. These companies have surpassed all growth expectations and, in some cases, opened facilities in more than one North Dakota city after experiencing great success with their first site.

Take a look at these examples of success for business-service companies:

Fargo is home to Microsoft's third largest campus.  Microsoft acquired Great Plains in 2001 and has over 1,800 employees.
Aetna opened a health insurance shared service center in 1990. It has grown to over 500 employees. The facility pays medical claims and answers telephone calls for members in the United States.
SEI Information Technology opened a facility in 1994 that offers computer systems design and related services. Today, SEI employs more than 400 in two North Dakota locations.
In 2012, ING Financial Services joined with Cognizant to offer a comprehensive array of insurance business process services in Minot.  The company has over 800 employees in the North Dakota location.
The US $5 million, 28,500-square-foot sales center for PepsiAmericas opened in May 2004. It is home to more than 230 employees as PepsiAmericas consolidated 13 US divisional sales offices in North Dakota. "Basically, what brought them here was the work ethic of our people," said Vice President and General Manager George Haugo.
The Unisys Shared Service Center opened in North Dakota in 1994 with 105 employees that handle global accounts payable services. Today, the facility of more than 220 has been recognized for its world-class customer service delivered in more than 10 languages.

 



Trucking
North Dakota offers excellent transportation access and is home to two main trade corridors for the nation: the central North American Trade Corridor spans the state as Highway 83, and the Red River Trade Corridor crosses North Dakota as Interstate 29. Both connect Canada with Mexico. In addition, Interstate 94 crosses North Dakota from east to west and is part of the 8,410 miles of highway the North Dakota Department of Transportation maintains.

North Dakota has 19 different international ports of entry. There are 18 ports along the North Dakota-Canadian border. Of these, three are open 24 hours a day. Along with the 18 border crossings, the Hector International Airport in Fargo is also considered a 24-hour port of entry in the country, according to the U.S. Customs Service.

Rail Service
Another way to link your business with other parts of the world is through North Dakota's rail system. Our rail system can move mass amounts of product via five railroads.

North Dakotas Rail System

Quickly and reliably move your products and supplies through one of our two Class I railroads. The Burlington Northern Sante Fe Railroad operates in North Dakota, including the transcontinental primary line reaching from Seattle to Chicago.

The CP Rail System (Soo Line) also traverses North Dakota on a line connecting Vancouver to Chicago.

To move freight within the state, consider using one of our Class III (short line) railroads. The Red River Valley & Western primarily serve southeast and central North Dakota. The Dakota, Missouri Valley & Western primarily serve the central and northwestern part of the state. The Northern Plains Railroad operates over 340 miles of track and primarily serves the northern and northeastern parts of the state.

Amtrak, North Dakota's only passenger rail service operates the Empire Builder from Chicago to Seattle and maintains seven North Dakota stations.
 
 


Air Service
North Dakota is connected to the global and technologically growing economy through eight commercial airports and 84 general aviation business airports.

Air Services Map

In addition; North Dakota has four international airports. Our central North American location provides a vital business link for east to west coast domestic flights in four hours or less. Via air, you are just 60 minutes from Minneapolis and 90 minutes from Denver.

Two North Dakota cities are recognized as general-purpose Foreign Trade Zones (FTZ). The Grand Forks FTZ consists of 48 acres located at the Grand Forks International Airport and in the Grand Forks Industrial Park. The Fargo zone is adjacent to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection port of entry at Hector International Airport, and covers six sites on 1,026 acres of land. A Foreign Trade Zone can save you time and money because foreign goods within the FTZ are considered to be in international commerce and not subject to customs duties unless or until they enter the U.S. In addition, raw materials, parts and components can enter duty-free. Goods can then be assembled, manufactured or processed - and the final product exported - without paying custom duties.

Biomass

















Beet pulp, grasses, wood chips and many other North Dakota byproducts are a candidate for possible biomass energy production.







North Dakota’s biomass industry has potential for significant contribution to the state’s economy as it evolves. Both North Dakota State University and the Energy and Environmental Research Center, University of North Dakota, have numerous projects underway for utilization of biomass. These projects include a wide variety of uses from gasification technology to nanofibers.

In addition, there are industry efforts underway to use crop residues and wood waste for ethanol or other energy applications. Commercial application is yet to be achieved as the state works to grow support for biomass as a viable industry in North Dakota.

Biomass in North Dakota

Research sponsors and North Dakota State University continue to work actively toward finalizing a business plan and developing the first energy beet to ethanol commercial installation. Energy beet field trials are being conducted at five regional locations across North Dakota in an effort to study productivity and sustainability. Beet and juice storage studies are also being conducted.
North Dakota State University has also developed the biomaterials used in the "bio-boom," a hybrid of 20 to 30 percent renewable biomaterials, flax fiber and fiberglass used in a crop sprayer manufactured by AGCO Corporation.
Great River Energy continues development of Dakota Spirit Ag Energy at Spiritwood, with the intent of adding cellulosic ethanol production once the backbone conventional ethanol facility is in operation. Biomass byproducts have potential for additional energy production.
North Dakota State University Researchers are collaborating with several companies, including Composite Innovations Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The research studies renewable biomaterials – everything from canola, soybeans, flax and more – in combination with petroleum-based polymers and plastics for an array of products.
Researchers at North Dakota State University continued to research the development of hybridized biomass in pellet form for use in manufacturing processes. Biocomposite pellets could replace up to 40 percent of petroleum-based plastics used in manufacturing.

Manufacturing





















Manufacturing accounts for 10 percent of North Dakota's Gross Domestic Product. While the rest of the country has experienced a manufacturing retraction since 2000, North Dakota has enjoyed an expansion. Strong market growth, both domestically and internationally, have contributed to a healthy manufacturing economy.

Manufacturing and technology-based businesses in North Dakota face a serious threat from off-shore competition. North Dakota manufacturers are not immune from the pressures of globalization and competition.

The Department of Commerce has concluded, through a combination of both a manufacturing survey and personal visits with manufacturing leaders across the state, that future expansion of our manufacturing sector will come not from labor growth, but rather from innovation and productivity gains, as well as a strong focus on developing foreign markets. State policy, both in terms of taxes and finance, should be examined to help stimulate and incent growth in this fashion.

The North Dakota Department of Commerce is committed to growing manufacturing.  Contact your Advanced Manufacturing Business Development Manager, David Lehman at 701-328-5378 to learn how we can help you with your business development needs!
 









Specific tactics used for advanced manufacturing includes the Dakota Manufacturing Extension Partnership which also assists manufacturers to help them become more competitive.
 


The Centers of Excellence program has also been used to strengthen North Dakota's manufacturers and technology-based businesses. Advanced Manufacturing Centers of Excellence include:

Strom Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (Dickinson State)
Dakota Center for Technology Optimized Agriculture (Lake Region)
Center for Advanced Electronics Design and Manufacturing (NDSU)
Center for Surface Protection (NDSU)
COE in Life Sciences and Advanced Technologies (UND)
Center for Integrated Electronic Systems (NDSU)
Center for Biopharmaceutical Research and Production (NDSU)
Center for Passive Therapeutics (UND)

 

 




			 



Finally, with support from the legislature, the North Dakota Trade Office has been able to increase its efforts to expand North Dakota's exports to high-demand foreign markets. In fact, North Dakota lead the nation in export growth in 2007 with 34%. Continued support and funding for the trade office is essential to continued market growth for our state's manufacturers.

APUC Fiscal Agents







Fiscal agents serve as an integral part of the grant program as they work closely with APUC staff and grantees to administer grant funds. For the duration of a grant, it is required of a fiscal agent to track all project expenditures and supplemental financial documentation according to the approved project budget.

At the close of the grant, the fiscal agent and grantee must coordinate efforts to compile the final report, consisting of an executive summary describing the work performed and results obtained, in addition to a supplemental financial report of all incurred project expenditures.     

Parties interested in applying for grant funds are encouraged to visit with APUC staff and economic advisors prior to submission of their proposal. Applicants must secure a qualified fiscal agent for the for these purposes for the duration of the project. Grant requests may also include an additional fiscal agent administrative fee of up to five percent of the amount requested, not to exceed $5,000, for their services. 

Applicants may contact APUC staff and their regional economic development agency for guidance in attaining professional staff eligible to be a fiscal agent.

Natural Gas

















Natural gas gathered and captured in North Dakota heats over two million homes in the U.S.







North Dakota produced 155 billion cubic feet of natural gas, processed 97 billion cubic feet of natural gas and paid $9.6 million in production taxes in 2011.  Over the past three years, North Dakota’s natural gas industry has worked hard to connect more than 2,100 new wells to gas plants.

There are 16 natural gas processing plants operating in western North Dakota. The oil and gas industry is investing nearly $3 billion in infrastructure to capture natural gas, and four additional new or expanded plants are planned to come online by 2013, a 389 percent increase in natural gas processing capacity. These plants will create hundreds of high-paying jobs in rural communities.

Natural Gas in North Dakota

Natural gas liquids present many opportunities for value-added energy. Research and studies exploring these possibilities provide great opportunities for expansion of the economic benefits beyond the oil-producing region.
As of 2010, North Dakota is the eighteenth largest natural gas producing state.
The North Dakota Industrial Commission, through the Oil and Gas Research Program in partnership with private parties, has invested more than $2 million in research for new technologies to capture and use natural gas at well sites. The results are intended to encourage and promote the use of new technologies that have a positive economic and environmental impact on oil and gas exploration. Examples include:
	
An $873,300 grant awarded to Bakken Express, LLC to use toward a $3 million natural gas capture initiative.
A $750,000 grant awarded to Energy & Environmental Research Center to use toward a $1.9 million natural gas capture initiative.
A $375,000 grant awarded to Blaise Energy, Inc. to use toward a $7.475 million natural gas capture initiative.

Energy


































































The  Great Plains Synfuels Plant near Beulah, ND, is the only commercial-scale coal gasification facility in the U.S. that manufactures natural gas.







Energy offers some of the greatest growth opportunities for North Dakota. Energy is the state's largest industry. Over the past several Legislative Sessions, the Governor and the Legislature have implemented a comprehensive package of state incentives to stimulate growth in all energy sectors and to create a broad-based energy strategy that maximizes all of North Dakota's energy resources.

North Dakota's energy incentives are working. Many new renewable energy projects have been completed, announced, or are under construction in the state. This includes wind projects that have been completed, are under construction, or filed letters of intent with the Public Service Commission.




When all of these projects are realized, they will have the capacity to produce:

325 million gallons of ethanol,
85 million gallons of biodiesel, and
2,500 megawatts of wind power.


Some of the new programs created to enhance energy production in North Dakota include EmPower ND Commission, Renewable Energy Program and the Biomass Incentive and Research Program. With the growth in renewable energy, progressive lignite coal development and the oil exploration occurring in the state, North Dakota's energy industry is seeing vigorous growth.

Transmission

















North Dakota produces far more energy than it uses, so transmission is key to moving power to parts of the country in need of it.







The development of new transmission in North Dakota continues to grow as companies construct lines to connect wind farms to the electric grid and to handle new load growth. At the same time a number of initiatives to study the impact of renewable resources on existing transmission systems identified new lines for the future, such as the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) multi-value projects (MVP lines) which were approved by the MISO board of directors in December 2011. These MVP lines will provide additional reliability to the MISO system as well as improving the North Dakota Export Constraint. In addition, the CapX 2020 program continued on its path to build five major transmission lines, three of which are important for the export of energy from North Dakota.

Transmission in North Dakota

North Dakota Transmission Authority conducted a study of the impact of oil and gas development in the Williston Basin on electric load growth and transmission infrastructure.
Basin Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. announced plans to construct 200 miles of 345 kV line from the Antelope Valley Station to a substation located near Tioga.
Minnkota Power Cooperative, Inc. began construction of 260 miles of 345 kV line to transport energy from the Milton R. Young station to the Grand Forks area.
The CapX 2020 project energized the first segment of the St. Cloud to Fargo 345 kV transmission line.
Great River Energy announced plans to rebuild 80 miles of 230 kV line between Grand Forks and Devils Lake.
MISO approved 17 multi-value projects, including transmission from North Dakota to eastern energy markets with an estimated capital investment of over $5.2 billion.
