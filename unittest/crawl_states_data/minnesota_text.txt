High Quality, Affordable Workforce
Minnesota is legendary for its highly skilled, highly motivated workforce and its unrivaled work ethic.
Our colleges and universities produce a steady supply of new talent, awarding thousands of undergraduate advanced degrees in computer and information sciences each year. We've got a labor force of 2.9 million and the 13th lowest unemployment rate in the nation (3.5 percent). Our labor force participation rate is the second-highest (71.2 percent) in the country.
Special incentives, lower business taxes, lower energy costs, top-shelf infrastructure and a highly skilled workforce make it more attractive than ever to build data and network operation centers in Minnesota. Read our Fact Sheet on Data Centers.

Arts, Culture & Entertainment Images

From jazz to giant spoons, craft breweries to fringe festivals
 
We love our arts and entertainment. And there’s a lot to love. Whatever you like in terms of culture, you’ll find that it’s being painted, sculpted, sung, danced, played, recited, performed, eaten and gulped in Minnesota.
 
Minnesota has a rich and diverse cultural landscape. Our historical residents have each left their mark on our state – from the Dakota and Ojibwe who first settled here, to the European immigrants of the 19th century, and more recently to the Hmong and Somali who have moved here.
 
Never a dull moment

An old saying goes “only the boring get bored,” and it is safe to say that Minnesota’s people and places leave little room for boredom. Whether you live for the roar of an open-air stadium, the calm corridors of an art institute or the hum of a county fair, there are endless ways to fill your free time in our state.
 
 Music, theater and visual arts



Renowned orchestras – including the Minnesota Orchestra and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra – and a rich theater scene with renowned venues such as Guthrie Theater and the Minneapolis Children’s Theater
Several world-class museums, including the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Walker Art Center and Sculpture Garden – with its iconic Spoonbridge and Cherry sculpture – and the Weisman Art Museum, among others 
Multiple venues that host national and international entertainers, including First Avenue nightclub and Dakota Jazz Club

 
Eating and drinking
 

Minnesota has become a top destination for foodies and craft brewery aficionados. 
 

Twelve Twin Cities chefs, bakers and restaurants were recently named 2018 semifinalists in the food world’s highest honors, the James Beard Foundation awards. 
The Wall Street Journal named Minneapolis the No. 4 spot on its “Where to Travel in 2018” list of 10 “hot destinations” worldwide.
 Craft breweries, like Surly, August Schell, Castle Danger and Summit have become popular destinations for locals. We have more than 110 craft breweries operating across the state. 

 
Popular fairs, malls, fests and districts



“The Great Minnesota Get-Together,” the Minnesota State Fair, attracts nearly 2 million visitors a year – and is the largest state fair in the U.S. based on average daily attendance.
Mall of America – the largest shopping mall in the U.S. – in Bloomington, Minn., attracts 40 million visitors each year from around the globe.
Paisley Park – music legend Prince’s private domain for more than two decades – recently opened for tours.
Festivals and special events abound – including music festivals (such as the Twin Cities Jazz Festival); theater festivals (the Fringe Festival with more than 1,000 artists performing over a 10-day period); art crawls, beer dabblers and much more.
USA TODAY named Northeast Minneapolis the nation’s top arts district in 2015, citing the studios, galleries and performance spaces developed from repurposed industrial buildings.

 
Greater Minnesota and the arts
 



Outside of the Twin Cities, Greater Minnesota has buzzing music and arts scenes. People travel from around the nation to attend the Great River Shakespeare Festival in Winona each summer, while St. Cloud, Duluth, Rochester and Moorhead all support their own independent city orchestras.
Popular annual music festivals – such as the country music WE Fest in Detroit Lakes, Minn., and the Bayfront Blues Festival in Duluth – draw crowds of thousands each year.
Lanesboro, Minnesota – named one of America’s 20 Best Small Towns several years ago by Smithsonian Magazine – has the Commonweal Theatre, which the magazine dubbed “one of the sharpest, most innovative small regional theaters in the country.”

Game on!
 
We’re big on sports. If there’s a ball or puck involved, we bounce it, shoot it, pass it, throw it, smack it, and slap-shot the daylights out of it. From the peewee leagues to the majors, sports are a year-round staple in Minnesota. 
 
We are one of just a handful of states that have teams in seven major sports leagues:
 


Vikings: National Football League
Twins: Major League Baseball
Timberwolves: National Basketball Association
Lynx: Women’s National Basketball Association
Wild: National Hockey League
Whitecaps: National Women's Hockey League
Minnesota United: Major League Soccer

 

College sports are also popular in Minnesota, with the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers representing the state in the Big Ten Conference and competitive collegiate teams located across our state.
 
Our sports venues are world class:
 


US Bank Stadium, which opened in Minneapolis in 2016, hosted Super Bowl 52 in 2018 and is hosting the Final Four in 2019.
The new Allianz Stadium will open in St. Paul in 2019 as the home of Minnesota United, our Major League Soccer team.
Target Field, home of the Minnesota Twins baseball team, opened in Minneapolis 2010 and was ranked that year by ESPN The Magazine as the #1 baseball stadium experience in North America. 
National Sports Center in Blaine, Minn., is the world’s largest amateur sports facility. It’s a 600-acre campus with over 50 grass soccer fields, an eight-sheet ice arena, 18-hole golf course and cycling velodrome.


 
Beyond stadiums and arenas



We use the Cathedral of St. Paul as a stunning backdrop for the annual Red Bull Crashed Ice sports event – and use our city streets for the annual Twin Cities Marathon, dubbed “The Most Beautiful Urban Marathon in America.”

Golf is hugely popular in Minnesota. In fact, the state has more than 400 golf courses. Minneapolis has more golfers per capita than any other city.

Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minn., will become the first U.S. course to host a second Ryder Cup when golf’s biggest event returns in 2028.

Hockey is also huge – and we hold the annual U.S. Pond Hockey Championships here, giving hockey enthusiasts a chance to experience the sport outdoors, on a lake, during the coldest time of year: “the way Nature intended.”

                    Education & Apprenticeships
                

In 2016, Minnesota produced about 28,000 graduates across 97 educational institutions in fields related to ten selected occupational fields: computer occupations, business specialists, engineers, life/physical scientists, life/physical science and engineering technicians, health technologists and technicians, assemblers/fabricators, metal/plastics production workers, and plant/system operators.




+ Minnesotans complete higher education degrees
Minnesota among nation's best in obtaining degrees



Leading fields of degrees are business (about 10,900), health professions (about 4,400), computer and information sciences (about 3,500), biological and biomedical sciences (about 3,000), engineering (about 2,100) and engineering technologies (about 1,100) in 2016. The main levels of awarded degrees were Bachelor’s degrees (43 percent), Associate’s degrees (18 percent) and Master’s degrees (17 percent).

In 2016, 93.5 percent of the Twin Cities population aged 25 and over had a high school degree, ranking the Twin Cities first among largest metropolitan areas, according to the Census Bureau. The national rate was 87.5 percent.

 










 



A DRAW FOR TALENT


Standout educational attainment rates help give Minnesota a workforce advantage. The Twin Cities metro area has an economic gravitational pull, drawing in educated workers from throughout the Upper Midwest and beyond. 

Because of the draw of the Twin Cities economy, Minnesota benefits from a net inflow of educated workers both regionally and beyond. Between 2011 and 2015, 36,420 with a bachelor’s degree or higher moved to Minnesota, a net inflow of 7,315 people. The majority of these people come from Minnesota’s border-states (Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin).

Minnesota’s colleges and universities play a key role in attracting potential international students and workers to Minnesota. Nearly 15,000 students from outside the U.S. attended Minnesota institutions in 2015-16, with the University of Minnesota leading the way with 7,037 international students (ranking 20th nationally). Further, almost 10,000 students attending Minnesota colleges and universities participated in study abroad programs in 2015-2016, and returned with global perspectives that likely enhance their work skills, creativity and interpersonal relationships.


APPRENTICESHIPS

Minnesota is promoting the employee training model through apprenticeship programs for businesses looking for a highly diverse and skilled workforce. Learn more about the incentives for businesses to implement an apprenticeship program and how to improve employee retention and recruitment. www.apprenticeshipmn.com

                    Health Care
                
            
        

There's just no way to talk about Minnesota's health care industry without using superlatives. Our reputation as a leader in health care services precedes us.
Our treatment and research facilities are the envy of the nation and world. And the sector is an extremely important part of the state's economy.
In fact, the future of medicine and health is being written in Minnesota, where renowned academic and research resources combine with a cadre of top-ranked providers to bring high-quality care, expertise and facilities to every corner of the state.
Minnesota's 144 hospitals and health systems employ more than 127,000 people. The state continues to be a leading venue for the medical device industry. And the expertise it has developed in health care and biotech is generating new opportunities in health care information technology, diagnostics, therapeutics and other medical technologies.
Spotlight on Mayo Clinic
Mayo Clinic in Rochester -- where hundreds of thousands of people from around the world come each year for the most advanced medical care available anywhere - is the epicenter of health-care innovation. Mayo Clinic ha been ranked as the best hospital in the country in both 2016-'17 and 2017-'18 by U.S. News and World Report.
Mayo employs more than 41,600 people in Minnesota and has over 3,000 staff physicians and scientist based here. A societal impact report it released in 2017 calculated that it contributed $28 billion to the U.S. economy through its business expenditures and employer multiplier effect.
Breakthrough research at Mayo runs across every spectrum of medicine, and its extensive clinical trials give Minnesotan residents and others access to state-of-the-art treatments.
The presence of Mayo, along with the new enterprises that spring from it and the companies that want proximity to it, are transforming the clinic's home city of Rochester.
The $5.6 billion Destination Medical Center (DMC) is a unique 20-year economic development initiative that aims to make Rochester even more of a global health care hub.
Anchored by Mayo, the plan includes Discovery Square, a sub-district of DMC housing science, technology and bio-business startups and research groups. The DMC initiative is expected to create more than 30,000 new jobs and generate about $7.5 to $8 billion in new net tax revenue over the next 35 years.
Medical Excellence Abounds
Nationally recognized hospitals blanket Minnesota with high quality care.
In addition to Mayo, Abbott Northwestern Hospital and University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis and St. Cloud Hospital were nationally ranked in certain specialties by U.S. News and World Report. Mayo Clinic ranked in 15 specialties and nine children's specialties; Abbott Northwestern in six specialties; St. Cloud Hospital in four specialties; and University of Minnesota Medical Center in one specialty and five children's specialties.
Overall, the health care and social assistance sector employs 471,800 workers in the state and has added 141,000 jobs since 2004. Four of the 10 largest employers in the state are in health care delivery.
Minnesota frequently ranks among the top states in health care:

2nd (tie) Best State for Health Care (WalletHub, 2017)
6th Healthiest State (America's Health Rankings, United Health Foundation, 2017)
7th Best State for Health Care (U.S. News & World Report, 2018)

Minnesota's leadership on patient safety and quality is recognized throughout the nation. The state's hospitals are spearheading dozens of patient safety initiatives to improve care, including a nation-leading reporting system on adverse health events, multiple patient safety calls to action and development of new methods of measuring quality.

A bounty of beauty
 
Scenic beauty and recreational opportunities are always nearby. Minnesota has an abundance of lakes, rivers and forests – and has the parks, trails, camping sites and public access ramps to enjoy them.
 
No matter the temperature, one thing holds true: the people of our state will be “out ‘n about” and actively enjoying the beautiful place we call home. Just imagine:


Seeing the Northern Lights while camping in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness
Boating or water-skiing on the Mississippi River with downtown Minneapolis as your backdrop
Fishing or kayaking on a peaceful lake near your home – even if you live in a large city
Cross-country skiing at night on a lit, well-groomed trail – with the stars twinkling above 

 

Minnesota has 90,000 miles of shoreline – more than California, Florida and Hawaii combined. We also have:
 


Nearly 12,000 lakes
76 state parks and recreation areas
1,030 miles of hiking trails and 22,000 miles of snowmobile trails 


 
Minnesotans are irresistibly drawn to every corner of our beautiful outdoors and abundant public waters and lands. Nearly 8 million people visit our state parks every year.
 
But we have quality as well as quantity. Minneapolis and St. Paul have the two best park systems in the entire country, according to the Trust for Public Land. In fact, they two cities have vied for the top spot – with Minneapolis taking first place and St. Paul second place in 2016 and 2017 – and with the two of them tying for first place in 2015.

				Grove
				
			

				Commissioner
			
DEED is led by Commissioner Steve Grove.
As commissioner of the state’s principal workforce and economic development agency, Commissioner Grove brings a wealth of private sector and civic experience to the Department of Employment and Economic Development. Originally from Northfield, Minnesota, Commissioner Grove is focused on growing the state’s workforce, closing the opportunity gap and providing businesses with the help they need to grow, stay and thrive.
Commissioner Grove was previously an executive at Google for 12 years, most recently serving as the founding director of Google’s News Lab, a global division of the company that partners with media companies and startups to drive innovation in the news industry. He has built teams in over a dozen countries and launched partnerships in over 50 countries, including a global technology training effort that trained over 500,000 people every year. Grove also led Google’s civic engagement work, including the company’s non-partisan voter information and get-out-the-vote outreach efforts. He previously led YouTube's first news and politics team, building a global partnership effort for political candidates, news organizations, nonprofits, and citizen journalists. The divisions of Google that Grove led during his career addressed a wide range of public challenges with new solutions: from fighting online disinformation campaigns, to growing social media citizen engagement with world leaders, to a developing a broad range of voter turnout initiatives.
Grove wrote for The Boston Globe and ABC News prior to joining Google. He has served as an advisor to the White House and State Department on counter-terrorism strategy, and serves on the advisory boards of Witness, a video human rights nonprofit, and Report for America, a nationwide service organization to improve local news.
Commissioner Grove holds a master's in public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School and a B.A. in philosophy, politics, and economics from Claremont McKenna College. He is an International Security Fellow at the New America Foundation, and co-founded a nonprofit with his wife Mary called Silicon North Stars, which helps youth from underserved communities in Minnesota pursue careers in technology. In 2018, the Groves moved from Silicon Valley to Minneapolis, Minnesota with their two-year-old twins.

                    Tax Incentives and Advantages
                
            
        

Valuable Tax Incentives

Companies that build data or network operation centers of at least 25,000 square feet and invest $30 million in the first four years qualify for valuable tax breaks.
Qualifying projects receive sales tax exemptions for 20 years on:

Computers and servers
Cooling and energy equipment
Energy use
Software

And pay no personal property tax. Ever.
Favorable Tax Advantages
Favorable tax provisions give Minnesota data centers important competitive advantages. The state's business taxes rank 20th-lowest in the nation. Minnesota's carry-forward and lack of a throwback encourage business startups. The refundable research and development credit (10 percent for the first $2 million, 2.5 percent thereafter) spurs innovation and helps offset some tax liabilities.
In addition, Minnesota DOES NOT tax:

Personal property
Inventories
Utilities
Internet access
Information services
Custom-created software

These exemptions, coupled with generous incentives and low tax liability on new investment, create an extremely favorable climate for data centers.
Apply for the Sales Tax Exemptions
To become a designated data center and receive the sales tax exemptions, companies must first be certified to participate in the program.
Complete this Data Center Certification Application and submit according to the instructions.
Learn more about how Minnesota Revenue processes sales tax refunds for qualified data center exemptions.
Special incentives, lower business taxes, lower energy costs, top-shelf infrastructure and a highly skilled workforce make it more attractive than ever to build data and network operation centers in Minnesota. Read our Fact Sheet on Data Centers.

                    Economic Impact
                
            
        
It is impossible to overstate the importance of manufacturing to Minnesota's economic well-being. The pocketbook impact on households statewide is tremendous, considering that manufacturing's direct and spin-off employment accounts for close to one-third of all jobs statewide. And those jobs tend to pay substantially higher on average.

Our Utility Rates are Causing Quite a Buzz
Minnesota's electric cost is competitive and exempt from sales tax. The annual rate of electricity for commercial users is lower than the U.S. average.
A typical data center using 120 to 200 million watts of electricity annually can save millions of dollars by locating in Minnesota. Our electric utilities have one of the nation's highest reliability rates. All electric utilities statewide offer special high-use rates and backup power programs to select customers.
Special incentives, lower business taxes, lower energy costs, top-shelf infrastructure and a highly skilled workforce make it more attractive than ever to build data and network operation centers in Minnesota. Read our Fact Sheet on Data Centers.

                    Overview
                
            
        

Minnesota is no johnny-come-lately when it comes to medical technology and improving human health. Mayo Clinic got its start here in 1889 and medical device maker Medtronic was founded here in 1949.
We’re known as Medical Alley – recognized by the Smithsonian as one of America’s six "Places of Invention," and the only location designated for health care invention and innovation.
Mayo Clinic – named the top hospital in the country in 2016 and 2017 by U.S. News & World Report – and the University of Minnesota provide exceptional patient care and form the state’s life science research backbone.
Both in partnership with these institutions and separately, more than a thousand companies of all sizes have made Minnesota a global epicenter of health care innovation. We rank:

1st in medical device presence, with three times the concentration of medical device industry employment as the national average
1st in medical device patents per capita
2nd in bioscience-related patents per capita

We’re boldly pursuing new avenues of medical technology and treatments in areas that include:

personalized medicine
microbiome
regenerative medicine
pharmacogenomics
digital health
stem cell research
bioinformatics
telemedicine
proteomics
3-D printed devices

Venture Capital and Export Growth
Health care – including medical devices and related products and services – received the largest share (49 percent) of the $495 million in venture capital investment made in Minnesota in 2017, according to the PwC/CB Insights MoneyTreeTM Report.
There’s an international appetite for medical products made in Minnesota. Optics/medical goods – including medical devices – were the state’s top export in 2017. Sales in this category were $3.8 billion, up 8 percent from the previous year.
Our Companies
From medical device and pharmaceutical powerhouses to feisty digital health and life science startups, Minnesota companies changing the way medicine is practiced. They’re are saving and improving lives with their innovations and breakthroughs.
Here’s just a sampling of the thousands of health-related companies that are based or have major operations in Minnesota:

3M Health Care
Abbott (formerly St. Jude Medical)
Boston Scientific
Mayo Clinic
Medtronic
Smiths Medical
Takeda Pharmaceuticals
UnitedHealth Group (including UnitedHealthcare and Optum)

                    Logistics: Our Extensive Infrastructure Keeps Commerce Moving
                
Minnesota ranks fifth nationally in infrastructure (CNBC, 2016). Supporting the state’s strong manufacturing sector is a modern transportation network that includes marine shipping, road, rail, air and digital infrastructure.
Minnesota Infrastructure Map - Our highly ranked system helps business operate smoothly – getting people and supplies where they need to be and moving products to market easily – whether in the U.S. or across the globe.
Road, Rail, Public Transit

A central U.S. location and extensive network of highways (including Interstates 35, 94 and 90) and railways (with 4,444 route miles serviced by about 20 railroad companies – including four Class I railroads) enable manufacturers to get supplies and to move their products where they need to go quickly and efficiently.

Minneapolis-St. Paul has the fourth lowest commute time to work (25.4 minutes) among the 30 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, according to 2015 data by the Census Bureau.

The American Public Transportation Association named the Twin Cities Metro Transit as the “System of the Year for 2016”, based on record ridership on the Green Line and improvements in safety and operations.

Metro Transit is the primary regional transit services provider with a ridership of 82 million in 2016, providing bus and light rail services.

Airports

Minnesota has a network of modern, industry-friendly airports. Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) is a large hub with 158 non-stop markets, 130 domestic markets and 29 international markets. The state has more than 140 public-use airports, including nine primary airports.

Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport was recognized as the Best Airport in North America among airports serving between 25 million and 40 million passengers. J.D. Power ranked MSP the sixth best mega airport for customer satisfaction in 2016, Travel + Leisure Magazine rated MSP a 2017 Top 10 Domestic Airport, and it’s a Top Five in the World easiest to get to airport by MSN.



+ Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport Top Ranked
How the MSP airport ranks nationally




MSP is the 16th busiest airport in terms of passengers in the U.S. with 37.5 million in 2016.

Minneapolis-St. Paul International is among the top cargo operations airports in the country, ranking 23rd with 1.2 billion pounds of landed cargo.

Shipping Capacity

Minnesota has four ports on Lake Superior, including and intermodal dry bulk port at Duluth/Superior and bulk ports at Taconite Harbor, Silver Bay, and Two Harbors.

The Port of Duluth-Superior is the largest and busiest shipping port by tonnage on the Great Lakes. It provides access to world markets, with shipments to Europe arriving in 15-18 days.

The Mississippi River system stretches more than 222 miles in Minnesota and supports five port areas across the Twin Cities and southeast regions of the state.

                    EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program
                
            
        
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Citizenship and Immigration Services division (USCIS) administers the Immigrant Investor Program, also known as EB-5.
The program is intended to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by offering foreign investors a permanent resident visa for investing $1 million (or at least $500,000 in a Targeted Employment Area) and creating or preserving at least 10 jobs for U.S. workers.
Investments can be made directly in a job-generating commercial enterprise or through a Regional Center, a third party-managed investment vehicle (private or public).
Get more information at the USCIS website.
Targeted Employment Areas
The USCIS defines a targeted employment area (TEA) as an area which, at the time of investment, is a rural area (not within either a metropolitan statistical area or the outer boundary of any city or town having a population of 20,000 or more), OR an area within an MSA or the outer boundary of a city or town having a population of 20,000 or more which has experienced unemployment of at least 150 percent of the national average rate.
Requirements for TEA Certification Letter from the State of Minnesota
Project developers may wish to have the site for their proposed project designated as lying within a TEA, thus qualifying for the lower individual investment threshold of $500,000.
The Labor Market Information Office at the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development may provide certification of such customized TEAs within Minnesota, as long as they meet the criteria established by the USCIS.
Unemployment rates at the census-tract level have been calculated for the entire state and may be used by project developers to propose a TEA for certification. The statistics are updated annually in May. For the latest unemployment statistics, contact Amanda Rohrer at 651-259-7398.
Project developers seeking customized TEA designation must submit the following information:

Name of individual investor or entity
Name of new business or project
Address of new business or project
City, county and zip code
Census tract number(s) to be included in proposed TEA
Map of census tract(s) to be included in proposed TEA
Calculations proving that the proposed TEA meets USCIS requirements
Description of the project, including job creation if applicable (500 words or fewer)
Mailing address for sending the certificate

Submit the information by email to Amanda Rohrer with the subject line "TEA Certification Application."
EB-5 Regional Centers
The Immigrant Investor Pilot Program was created by Section 610 of Public Law 102-395 (Oct. 6, 1992), and has been extended. EB-5 requirements for an investor under the Pilot Program are essentially the same as in the standard EB-5 investor program, except the Pilot Program provides for investments that are affiliated with an economic unit known as a "Regional Center."
Investments made through regional centers can take advantage of a more expansive concept of job creation including both "indirect" and "direct" jobs. A Regional Center is defined as any economic entity, public or private, which is involved with the promotion of economic growth, improved regional productivity, job creation and increased domestic capital investment.
The organizers of a regional center seeking the "Regional Center" designation from USCIS can find more detailed information on the process and requirements at the USCIS website. The following Regional Centers have been approved or have approval pending by the USCIS to facilitate investment in Minnesota (Disclaimer: The listing of these organizations does not imply endorsement):

North Dakota/Northwest Minnesota EB-5 Regional Center
International Creative Capital of Minnesota
Liberty Minnesota Regional Center

If you are organizing or operating a Regional Center to promote investment in projects based in Minnesota and wish to have your Regional Center listed here, contact the Trade Assistance Helpline at 651-259-7498 or email Mto.TradeAssistance@state.mn.us.
EB-5 Investor Program Study
This study explores options and makes recommendations about how the state of Minnesota could use the federal Immigrant Investor Program, known as EB-5, as a job-creation tool in the state. The study may guide state policies or actions surrounding EB-5 in the future, but no official positions have been proposed, adopted or programs implemented.

				Danna
				
				Mackenzie
				
			

				Executive Director
			
Danna MacKenzie joined DEED in January 2014 when she was appointed Executive Director of the newly-created Office of Broadband Development. 
 
She is responsible for broadband planning and policy development statewide. In this role, she oversees a portfolio of $85 million dollars in broadband infrastructure investments across the state and works with various stakeholders – including the Governor, legislators, providers and communities – to help inform and guide the adoption of effective state broadband policies.  
 
MacKenzie has 23 years of experience working with internet providers and Minnesota communities on broadband issues. Before coming to DEED, she spearheaded a number of broadband projects, including the deployment of countywide wired and wireless networks and building a cooperative internet service provider in 1994 for the purpose of serving emerging local business needs. She has also worked with a non-profit foundation to expand the capacity of rural Minnesota communities to leverage the power of broadband.
 
MacKenzie has held positions on numerous committees and boards, including serving as chair of the Minnesota Counties Information Systems board of directors; a founding member of the Minnesota Counties Information Technology Leaders Association; administrator for the Cook County Broadband Commission; and a peer leader in the State Broadband Leaders Network which is convened by the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications Information Administration. Most recently, she was appointed by the Chairman of the FCC to serve on a Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee working group. She holds a bachelor’s degree from Concordia University in St. Paul.

Fueling Green Growth and Innovation
Minnesota is changing the way the country is producing and consuming energy, food and health products through biomaterials and biotechnology.
The state was the first in the country to require a 5 percent biodiesel blend in most diesel fuels. Minnesota ranks first in the number of gas pumps (378) offering E85 (2018) and fourth in ethanol production capacity with 1.2 billion gallons (2017).
The state is also home to internationally known biomaterials superpowers such as Cargill and 3M – as well as a deep bench of smaller companies developing and selling innovative products.
Biofuels and Biomaterials Companies
In addition to fuels, our companies produce everything from clothing, bottles, films, packaging and textiles made from renewable polymers to isobutanol, a versatile chemical for the liquid fuels and petrochemical market.
Biofuels and biomaterials companies include:

3M
Advanced BioEnergy
Al-Corn Clean Fuel
Archer Daniels Midland
BioAmber
Cargill
Central MN Renewables/Green Biologics
Chippewa Valley Ethanol Co.
Corn Plus
Gevo
Granite Falls Energy
Green Plains
Highwater Ethanol
Minnesota Soybean Processors
NatureWorks
Valero Renewable Fuels

Sources: Hoovers Database, company websites
R&D Partnership Opportunities
The potential for collaboration and partnership in the research, development and commercialization of biomaterials and biofuels is tremendous.
The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is a research leader when it comes to the production of bioenergy and biobased products that will lead to the development of sustainable regional systems. The university’s department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering’s research and academic programs are at the forefront of discovery. Core areas include bioprocessing, environmental and ecological engineering, food production and advanced building systems, and energy efficiency.
Biofuels Incentives
The Bioincentive Program offered through the Minnesota Department of Agriculture provides production payments to encourage commercial-scale production of advanced biofuels, renewable chemicals, and thermal energy production from biomass. Learn more.

Creating Breakthroughs, Transforming Lives
We "wrote the book" when it comes to pushing the frontiers of medical technology and improving human health.
This quickly changing industry defies easy categorization, with new therapies combining technologies and crossing sectors. But Minnesota, a long-time leader in medical devices, is active in all areas of health research and development, including personalized medicine, bioinformatics, proteomics, microbiome, regenerative medicine, pharmacogenomics, stem cell research, telemedicine, 3-D printed devices and more.
With the internationally renowned Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota providing exceptional patient care and forming the state’s life science research backbone, great possibilities exist for collaboration and partnerships between academia and companies. Read our Fact Sheet on Biosciences.
 







Overview


Minnesota companies are developing remarkable solutions to tackle diseases.

  



Medical Devices


A medical device pioneer since the 1940s, we're not letting up now.

  



Health Care


Our treatment and research facilities are the envy of the nation and world.

Success is a Breeze
For companies that make their living in the wind industry, Minnesota is the place to build a North American manufacturing and distribution base.
One of the top states in the nation for installed wind capacity, Minnesota has the right combination of natural and business resources you need to succeed in this competitive field.
Many Minnesota companies manufacture components for the wind industry. Search our Made in Minnesota database to find suppliers.

Logistic Advantages
Located in the Heart of North America
Minnesota is within 500 to 1,000 miles of several leading wind energy states and the major Canadian provinces focused on wind power.
Other U.S. Midwestern states and Canadian provinces have strong renewable mandates, too, leaving Minnesota manufacturers well positioned to sell regionally as well as globally.
Exceptional Transportation Infrastructure
Minnesota has a world-class system of ports, railroads, highways, and airlines. The Port of Duluth handles a significant portion of sea-based transportation of turbines and wind-related machinery.

In 2015, the port ranked first in North America by the Railway Industrial Clearance Association (RICA).
At the crossroads of major highways and four Class I railroads (BNSF, CN, CP and UP), the Port of Duluth is ideally situated to handle large cargo.
By volume, logistics experts rank Duluth among the top 10 in North America for transporting wind turbine components.

Cool, Calm and Cost-Efficient
Minnesota's moderate climate means cooler temperatures and fewer storms.
Outside air is a natural alternative for keeping servers cool while lowering utility costs. For companies interested in advanced technology that uses lake water for data center cooling, Minnesota has nearly 12,000 lakes.
Moderate average seasonal temperatures make Minnesota less prone to storms and decrease the possibility of costly storm-related damage and downtime.
Special incentives, lower business taxes, lower energy costs, top-shelf infrastructure and a highly skilled workforce make it more attractive than ever to build data and network operation centers in Minnesota. Read our Fact Sheet on Data Centers.

The Industrial Partnership for Research in Interfacial and Materials Engineering (IPRIME) at the University of Minnesota brings industry professionals and university researchers together in research on interfacial and materials science.

The Initiative for Renewable Energy and the Environment (IREE) has quickly become a central part of Minnesota’s renewable energy economy, mobilizing nearly 400 experts around one vital mission: the development of bio-based and other renewable energy resources and processes. With state funding of $5 million per year, IREE supports research in renewable energy and the environment. IREE also seeks and supports the expertise and resources of private business and industry, state public agencies, and the nonprofit sector.

Research at the U of M’s Institute of Technology is exploring the reaches of space, unlocking the secrets of Earth, expanding the powers of information technology. Experts are also applying engineering and technology to problems in medicine, biology, and the environment.

                    Demographics: A Growing and Increasingly Diverse Population
                
Minnesota’s growing population of 5.5 million people is increasing in racial diversity.
Current population projections show growth in racial diversity that exceeds the national average. The Twin Cities population is projected to grow from 3.58 million in 2017 to 3.74 million by 2027, an increase of nearly 164,000. This amounts to 5 percent growth, compared to 4 percent growth nationally.
 







Statewide Projected Population Growth (By Percentage) 2005-2035Race & Ethnicity



 



In Minnesota, non-Hispanic or Latino white people make up about 81 percent of the population, while people of color (those who identify as a race other than White alone, and/or those who are non-white) currently make up about 19% of the state’s total population. In the Twin Cities (7-county) area, people of color make up 24 percent of the population.



+ Minnesota's  diverse workforce
See statistics of Minnesota workers by occupation and region



All race groups have grown recently in Minnesota, but between 2010 and 2015, the high growth rates of people of color populations far exceed those of the non-Latino White population. Populations of color are more likely to live in metro areas than rural areas.

Between 2005 and 2035, Minnesota’s population is expected to increase by 24 percent statewide. In particular, the state’s populations of color are expected to grow by 121 percent. By 2035, the state’s population is expected to be 6.4 million, with about one-quarter represented by people of color.

In 2016, the percentage of working-age people with disabilities who were looking for work was 7.4 percent. Comparatively, the percentage of working-age people without disabilities actively looking for work was 18.8 percent. The average percentage of people of color working-age people who reported a disability was 11.98 percent compared to 8.5 percent of white working-age people.

                    Overview
                
            
        

Food We Produce
Minnesota leads the nation in food patents per capita – and has long been on the forefront of research and innovation in agriculture, food production and food safety.
Our rich prairie soils, good growing season and plentiful water resources have helped make the state an agricultural and food production powerhouse. We rank:

4th in crops
5th in total agricultural production
8th in livestock

For more than 50 years, starting in the late 1800s, Minneapolis was known as the "Flour Milling Capital of the World."
Today, agricultural production and processing in Minnesota accounts for $57.5 billion in output and over 147,000 jobs, according to the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.
The state ranks 8th in the number of farms – 73,000 – and 7th in the number of USDA-certified organic farms.
Top Crops and Exports
Minnesota ranks among the top 10 in more than two dozen agricultural products, including:

1st in turkeys raised, sugar beets
2nd in hogs, sweet corn for processing, green peas, oats, wild rice
3rd in soybeans, dry beans, sunflowers
4th in corn, canola, rye, flaxseed
5th in mink pelts
6th in barley
8th in milk, wheat, potatoes, honey, mohair
9th in cattle and calves
10th in poultry and eggs

Minnesota exports about $7.1 billion for total agricultural commodities and related food products. The top four exported products and their national rankings are:

Soybeans: $2.1 billion, ranked 3rd
Corn: $959 million, ranked 4th
Feed grains: $738 million, ranked 4th
Pork: $716 million, ranked 2nd

Sources: Minnesota Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Agriculture
Top Companies
Not surprisingly, Minnesota is home to some of the nation’s largest agricultural, food production and distribution companies – many with a global reach. Among them:

Cargill
CHS
General Mills
Hormel Foods
Land O’Lakes
Mosaic
Rosen’s Diversified
Schwan’s
SuperValu

A Leader in Food Innovation
Minnesota is at the heart of food product innovation, helping meet consumer demand for healthy, local food products. We’re also a go-to spot for food and agriculture research – from finding ways to improve crop yields and produce healthier plants and livestock to developing new food products and ensuring food safety.
Products made by our food manufacturing industry are valued at over $27 billion a year. This is our largest manufacturing sector by employment – accounting for more than 47,000 jobs. We also make the tools, equipment and machinery needed for agriculture and food production. Find out more in What We Make.
Our knack for food innovation can be seen in products such as Angie’s BoomChickaPop popcorn, our many craft breweries, as well as the many restaurants that have earned national acclaim. Three Minnesota restaurateurs were among the five finalists for Best Chef: Midwest in the 2018 James Beard Awards, and one – Gavin Kaysen of Spoon and Stable in Minneapolis – won that honor.
Per capita, we rank first in food patents – and ninth in food scientists and technologists.
The University of Minnesota has helped educate generations of agricultural producers and processors through its degree programs and extension system. It also has long been a leader in agriculture, livestock and food research.
Among the state's many public and private agriculture and food education and research facilities are:

University of Minnesota (U of M) College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences
Agriculture Extension (U of M)
Food Science and Nutrition (U of M)
Research and Outreach Centers (U of M)
Joseph J. Warthesen Food Processing Center (U of M)
The Food Industry Center (U of M)
Food Research Centers (U of M)
Agricultural Utilization Research Institute
Minneapolis Research & Development Center and Cargill Food Innovation Center
Cargill Animal Nutrition Innovation Campus

State’s reputation: A ‘Snow Job’?
 
Ask a non-Minnesotan why they don’t live in Minnesota and nine out of 10 will say “it’s too cold” or “there’s so much snow.”
 
But ask a Minnesotan – even a transplant from another state – what they love most about Minnesota and many will mention the “four distinct seasons” or wax poetic about our wonderful spring, summer and fall.
 
Facts first:
 
Temperatures: Over the past 35 years, there has been a clear, upward trend in the average low temperatures in Minnesota. That’s not to say it doesn’t get cold, but lately we’ve seen 62 degrees in February. And the USDA has updated its plant-hardiness zone map, broadening the range of plants that can now flourish in the state.
 
Snowfall: Minnesota gets less snowfall than quite a few other places. Syracuse, N.Y., for instance, gets more than 2.5 times more snow on average than Minneapolis-St. Paul. What’s more, we’re so prepared for snow that it doesn’t slow us down – unlike places where a couple of inches will shut down schools, businesses and airports for days at a stretch. In fact, Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) was recently ranked the most on-time airport of its size in the world – a testament to our all-weather readiness.
 
Sunshine: Minnesota receives more sunlight hours in mid-winter than many other warmer parts of the country, including all of the Great Lakes states, the Pacific Northwest, parts of the South and almost all of the Northeast.
 
Minnesotans are fun people – and we know how to have a good time. We take it as a personal challenge to make the most of all our seasons – especially winter. Here are just a few examples of things Minnesotans do when it’s cold:
 


Go fat tire biking in the snow on one of the trails around the state that are groomed for this increasingly popular sport.
Enjoy the St. Paul Winter Carnival – the oldest winter festival in the United States. In 2018, 4,000 blocks of ice were cut from Green Lake near Spicer, Minn., to build the carnival’s 70-foot-tall ice palace.
Take part in Ice Box Days in International Falls – which includes frozen turkey bowling and moonlight skiing. 
Hide away in a skyway – Minneapolis, St. Paul and Duluth make it easy to avoid the outdoors. Minneapolis has the most extensive skyway in the world; it covers 80 city blocks and provides about 10 miles of climate-controlled comfort.

 
A Minnesota Myth Debunked 




Average snowfall in Syracuse, New York: 
123.8 inches; almost 10 feet per year

 

Average snowfall in Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN:
45.3 inches; less than 4 feet per year

Supply chain is critical to smooth business operations. From transportation and warehousing to logistics and distribution, Minnesota has companies that can help – as well as companies that prove what a good place Minnesota is to locate these types of businesses.
For example:
C.H. Robinson, based in Eagan, Minn., started as a small wholesale brokerage house in the early 1900s and is now a Fortune 500 worldwide provider of multimodal transportation services, third-party logistics and supply chain optimization.
Digi-Key Electronics, based in Thief River Falls, Minn., has grown from a small distributor of ham radio parts into one of the biggest distributors of electronic components in the world, with over $2 billion in annual revenue and a 2.2 million-square-foot expansion in the works.
In addition to having top-notch infrastructure, Minnesota has seen significant growth in its transportation and warehousing sector. This sector has almost 3,700 establishments and employs 71,243 people – up 20 percent between 2010 and 2017, according to EMSI.
When it comes to wholesalers, Minnesota has almost 13,000 establishments and ranks 12th nationally in jobs, with 134,386 jobs – up 6 percent between 2010 and 2017, according to EMSI.

Events and Outreach
Here are some ideas to help you organize Manufacturers Week events in your community to raise public awareness of the importance of manufacturing to the state and local economy and recognize local companies
Arrange Plant Tours
Encourage local manufacturers to invite their legislators or local officials to tour their facilities to see the kinds of manufacturing operations taking place in their district. Contact the Secretary of State to find your legislators and other officials. Facility Tour Talking Points will get them started.
For information on hosting a tour for the "Dream It! Do It!" statewide tour of manufacturing, contact your local CareerForce.
Follow these steps on becoming a host.
Become a Sponsor
Sponsorships support a variety of needs, including funding school tours, bussing and outreach to share these tour opportunities with students, teachers and community members so all attendees can connect and engage with Dream It! Do It! Minnesota resources dedicated to promoting what manufacturing is today - a viable career choice! Learn more about becoming a sponsor.
Sponsor an Event or Forum
Sponsor a chamber of commerce lunch or dinner to recognize local industry leaders or legislative candidates. Or ask the local Rotary Club or other civic groups to invite manufacturers to speak at one of their meetings and to invite local businesses to attend.
Sponsor an informal breakfast or lunch and invite local legislators or other officials to listen to manufacturers concerns about their business, their issues and the jobs they provide in the community. Recognize local manufacturers for their high-skill, high-wage jobs.
Engage Elected Officials
Arrange for your mayor, legislators and officials to spend a morning --even the entire day -- at different companies job shadowing employees or participating in a manufacturing company quality or team meeting. Host a lunch or dinner afterward and have participants share perspectives and what they learned. Ask the mayor to declare Minnesota Manufacturing Week in your community, using the provided template.
Reach Out to Media
There are many ways to reach out to the media and spread the news about the important of manufacturing. Here are a few:

Contact local newspapers, radio and television stations and ask them to do mini-profiles on manufacturing companies in the community.
Buy a print or online ad and use social networking (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) to inform your community of manufacturing-related events and the importance of manufacturing and technology to the state and community.
Write an article, commentary or letter to the editor for your local newspaper or trade association publication.

Plan a Public Event
The possibilities are nearly endless for interesting public events. Here are a few to consider:

Enlist a speaker to discuss manufacturing and technology and its importance to the state.
Encourage local manufacturing companies to open their facilities to employees' families, school groups and/or the public for facility tours.
Organize a locally-led Parade of Manufacturers modeled on the popular Parade of Homes tours.

Plan an Educational Event
Work with area schools to educate and inform students on the career benefits of manufacturing in Minnesota. Use the Minnesota Manufacturers Quiz to stimulate discussion.
CAREERwise Education, a comprehensive career, education and job resource, devotes a section to manufacturing careers that is particularly good for young adults and teens.
Ask the local public and school libraries to showcase books on math and science careers, quality, and new-product inventions during Minnesota Manufacturers Week.
Sponsor a product showcase or training trade fair at the community center or shopping mall. Ask local factories to loan product samples for the showcase. For a training trade fair, invite local colleges to set up a display highlighting manufacturing training and programs, including opportunities for exploration such as Camps to Careers, Zap Camps, and FIRST Robotics available to youth throughout Minnesota.


General Manufacturing Talking Points for 2018
When speaking to media, preparing speeches or written commentaries, or planning presentations on the importance of manufacturing in Minnesota, don't forget to include these key talking points.

Facility Tour Talking Points
These suggested talking points, excerpted from the Plant Tour Planning Guide, published by the National Association of Manufacturers and the Manufacturing Institute, will help visitors understand the effect your company has on the community and surrounding area.
Key points you might discuss during the facility tour include:

Products Manufactured - Describe how the products are used, where and how they're marketed and the value of products exported
Jobs - Discuss the number of people employed in the plant and other locations, kinds of occupations, labor unions represented, and worker health, safety and training programs. Discuss educational backgrounds and requirements for company positions. Do you offer apprenticeships or internships?

Employee Benefits - Talk about family-sustaining wages you pay, as well as other benefits including tuition reimbursement. Talk about the value in cents-per-hour-per-employee or as a percentage of the basic wage rate.

Success Stories - Discuss how your business and its products have improved the lives of employees and customers. Tell visitors about the history of the company and the company's investment in facilities, training and equipment.

Community Impact - How many dollars does the company pay in federal, state and local taxes? What are the company's local expenditures for supplies, materials, and services? Does the company participate in community programs or philanthropic activities? Describe the company's green initiatives, recycling efforts and energy use.

	                                                Leading Companies
	                                            






Overview
Water and wastewater treatment is expected to grow into a $22 billion industry over the next two years. And with Minnesota-based companies like 3M, Dow, Ecolab, GE and Pentair leading the industry, the state is well-positioned to capture much of that growth.
Innovative water-tech companies are drawn to Minnesota by these key advantages:
A Growing Cluster
The state's water-tech industry is both strong and diverse, employing nearly 15,500 workers. National and international demand for product continues to grow at a vigorous pace, as does interest in the state's unusual concentration of expertise in the industry.
Robust Networks
Minnesota is home to excellent universities with unrivaled expertise in water technology and abundant human capital. But brain-power is just the beginning. The state is also rich in world-class financial, legal, and logistics companies to support every step in the product cycle.
Collaborative Environment
State and local governments partner with business and industry to ensure that companies can easily startup, relocate or expand operations, find workers with the right skills, and access the technical expertise they need.
Prime Location
Minnesota's central North American location is a true logistical advantage. Exceptional rail, waterway, air and road access make reaching global suppliers and customers easy and affordable. 
Excellent Business Climate
An ample supply of skilled and educated workers, a long tradition of high-tech, precision manufacturing, a track record of innovation and success, add up to an irresistible combination for water-tech companies. 
A Leading Water-Tech Exporter
With more than $729 million in foreign sales in 2012, Minnesota is among the top 10 U.S. exporters of water and wastewater technology. The state's water-tech exports have grown 170 percent over the past decade. 
Voice of the Future
Ecolab CEO Doug Baker talks about the promising future of Minnesota's water cluster during a water technology summit in 2014. 


Water Industry Report
Minnesota’s water industry is creating high-paying jobs and improving access to clean water across the state and world. This growing industry—combined with Minnesota’s collection of water companies, complementary industries, supporting institutions, policies and laws—may suggest an emerging water cluster. Minnesota’s Water Industry Profile is the state’s most comprehensive look at trends in this fast-growing industry.
Key Findings
Minnesota’s water industry includes a variety of companies and organizations that create or provide products or services to improve the use, quality and flow of water.
The industry, led by its Fortune 500 companies, has experienced strong employment growth. The state’s water industry employed about 13,500 workers in 2014 and grew three times faster than overall state employment over the last decade.
Water jobs tend to be good jobs. Average annual wages in the water industry were about $65,500 in 2014, 27 percent higher than the state average annual wage of $51,600.
Minnesota is advancing innovation in water with strong patenting and exports. On a per capita basis, Minnesota was third in water technology patents in 2014. From 2004 to 2014,
Minnesota’s water technology exports were in top ten nationally and more than doubled from $430 million to $870 million (adjusted for inflation).
At the center of all successful cluster efforts are excellent universities. The University of Minnesota offers highly regarded water-specific programs, employs some of the nation’s leading water technology researchers, and connects industry to ideas and inventions.
This analysis finds that the state has an emerging water cluster. With proper growth and investment, a water cluster would increase innovation, productivity, and prosperity. The public and private sector can assist in this growth by fostering industry partnerships, investing in new technologies, and creating a Minnesota water technology brand.

Promising Water-Tech Sectors
Water supplies around the world are under tremendous pressure. The United Nations predicts that 2 billion people will face water scarcity by the year 2050.
To address this impending crisis, an estimated $22 trillion in water infrastructure investments will be necessary worldwide by 2030. Minnesota companies have special expertise in several important areas.
Water Treatment and Reuse
Minnesota is home to major operations of Ecolab, GE, and Pentair, recognized by Citi Research & Analysis as the world's top water reuse companies. 
No other state has such a concentration of this kind of expertise. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that the amount of recycled water will double over the next five years.
Filtration, Desalination and Membranes Technology
Named among the world's top seven companies for membrane technology,  Minnesota-based Dow, GE, Pentair and 3M have invested millions in advanced filtration. Morgan Stanley projects that membrane technology alone will grow an impressive 42 percent from $3.3 billion in 2010 to $4.7 billion in 2016.
Pumping
Efficient pumps are vital to booming industries like desalination, irrigation and wastewater treatment. Minnesota ranks fifth in the nation for pumping equipment manufacturing employment overall, and second in the Midwest.
Aeration
With long-established innovators like Aeration Industries and Aeromix Systems, Minnesota has developed an strong competitive advantage in the export of aeration technologies.


Leading Companies
Pentair
Minneapolis-based Pentair (now merged with Tyco Flow Control) is a global water flow management and filtration powerhouse, with $7.7 billion in annual revenues.
The firm's nanofiltration technology is helping meet growing global demand for water purification.
Ecolab
Ecolab's acquisition of Nalco, the world's largest maker of industrial water treatment technology, positions it at the forefront of an industry expected to grow 5.9 percent annually.
3M
Renowned innovator 3M makes water filters and sensors that detect leaks in water infrastructure. Considering that 20 percent of municipal water is lost annually to leaks, this product can dramatically decrease waste.
Suez Water Technologies & Solutions (formerly GE)
The company has a center of excellence in Minnesota for manufacturing of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes.
Dow Water & Process Solutions
The Edina-based company manufactures water purification and desalination membranes, employing 500 people.
Aeration Industries International
A pioneer in aeration technology, the company has sales in 92 countries worldwide.
Open Systems International
Offers applications to manage and optimize large water and hydro networks.
NewWater
A startup that launched with technology licensed from the University of Minnesota, the company creates filters that use enzymes to reduce atrazine concentrations in water. 
Waterfilters.net
A Minnesota-based online superstore for water filters, the company saw its revenue nearly quadruple in less than five years.

                    Innovation in Action
                
            
        


When it comes to research, development and manufacturing of medical devices, Minnesota is the envy of the world.
An Innovative Force and Economic Powerhouse
Over the decades, this dynamic industry cluster has been responsible for an astonishing number of breakthrough technologies and treatments. The implantable cardiac pacemaker, mechanical heart valves, and implantable infusion pumps are just a few of the homegrown innovations that have saved and improved lives everywhere. 
The medical device industry is also an extraordinarily important pillar of Minnesota's economy, employing nearly 30,000 people in the state alone and generating billions in revenue. Such industry powerhouses as 3M Health Care, Abbott (St. Jude Medical), Boston Scientific, Medtronic, and Smiths Medical are just a few of the prominent companies that are located in Minnesota or have a significant presence here.
Defining the Industry
The medical device industry produces instruments, apparatuses, implants, machines (or their component parts and accessories) and certain chemicals that are used to prevent, diagnose, treat or cure diseases in human beings or animals. 
Medical devices can range from something as simple as a tongue depressor, a cold pack or a pair of crutches to highly complex programmable cardiac pacemakers and laser surgical devices. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration groups devices by medical specialty into 19 broad classifications. Cardiovascular, orthopedics, ophthalmology, general surgery, neurological products, and imaging are a few examples.
Minnesota has one of the strongest and most diverse medical device clusters in the world.
Investing in the Industry
Its long history of innovation and success means Minnesota's medical device industry tends to attract a large portion of the state's venture capital investment. In 2017, Minnesota received $495 million in venture capital investment according to PwC. Of the total, investors pumped almost half into the state's medical device and health care industries.
Powerful Partnerships
The partnership between innovative companies, the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic (both recognized leaders in the biosciences) creates an ideal environment for turning  new ideas into commercial success.
Mayo Clinic works with health care and medical technology companies.
The University of Minnesota's Industrial Partnership for Research in Interfacial and Materials Engineering (IPRIME) is a unique corporate membership-sponsored program where companies can use students, faculty and equipment for research.
The University's Institute for Engineering in Medicine, Medical Devices Center and Visible Heart Lab combine health sciences and engineering to develop talents and products and provide a place to test new medical devices.

Tax Credits
Greater Minnesota Job Expansion Program 
Greater Minnesota Job Expansion Program provides sales tax exemptions of up to 12 years to eligible existing businesses located in Greater Minnesota that meet eligibility requirements including specified job creation and wage level.
Data Centers 
Companies that build new data or network operation centers of at least 25,000 square feet and invest $30 million, or refurbish an existing center of at least 25,000 square feet and invest $50 million, qualify for sales tax exemptions for 20 years on computers and servers, cooling and energy equipment, energy use and software, and they pay no personal property tax ever. Companies have 48 months to complete a new center and 24 months to complete a refurbished center.
Research and Development Tax Credit 
The tax credit for R & D expenditures is 10 percent, up to the first $2 million in eligible expenses. The credit is 2.5 percent for eligible expenses above $2 million.
Individuals involved in partnerships, S-corporations and limited liability companies are allowed to claim the credit against their individual income taxes. This opens up the tax credit to more small and medium-sized businesses.
Border Cities Enterprise Zones 
The Border-Cities Enterprise Zone Program provides property tax credits, debt financing credit on new construction, sales tax credit on construction equipment and materials, and new or existing employee credits to qualifying businesses in the border cities of Breckenridge, Dilworth, East Grand Forks, Moorhead, and Ortonville, as well as in the Development Zone of Taylor's Falls.
Opportunity Zones 
Opportunity zones use federal tax incentives in low-income urban and rural communities nationwide to draw long-term investment to areas that are in the most economic need by creating a fund for these investments.
Tax Increment Financing 
Cities, counties, and development authorities may use tax increment financing to help finance costs of real estate development to encourage developers to construct buildings or other private improvements and to pay for public improvements, such as streets, sidewalks, sewer and water, and similar public infrastructure improvements that are related to the development.
Tax Abatement 
Cities, counties and school districts may use tax abatement to help finance certain economically beneficial projects. Property taxes are forgiven for a period of time to allow the project to cash flow. Or the taxes are captured for a period of time and an up-front payment is made by the political subdivision to help the project cover start up costs.
Learn More about tax credits in Minnesota.


Loans and Grants
Minnesota Investment Fund 
Offering a maximum of $500,000 per loan, the fund focuses on industrial, manufacturing, and technology-related industries. We award grants to local units of government, which use the money to provide below-market rate loans to help companies expand. Funding may be used to purchase land, machinery and equipment.
Minnesota Job Creation Fund 
The fund provides up to $1 million in grants to approved businesses after specified job creation and capital investment goals are achieved. Minimum requirements: 10 jobs created and $500,000 capital investment in the Twin Cities, 5 jobs at $250,000 outside the TC metro area. Actual job creation and capital investment rebates are based on project parameters. Up to $2 million is available for large projects.
Emerging Entrepreneur Loan Program
This program provides loans to businesses owned and operated by minorities, low-income persons, women, veterans and/or persons with disabilities. DEED provides grant funds to a network of nonprofit lenders which use these funds for loans to start-up and expanding businesses throughout the state.
MN Reservist and Veteran Business Loan Program 
This program provides interest free, business loans of up to $20,000 to businesses that are adversely affected when certain employees are called to active military duty and to individual veterans who have returned from active duty and want to start their own business.
Indian Business Loan Program 
The program supports the development of Indian-owned and operated businesses and promotes economic opportunities for Indian people in Minnesota. Loans may be up to 75 percent of project costs and feature favorable interest rates and repayment terms.
Minnesota Innovation Loans for Entrepreneurs (MILE)
The Minnesota Innovation Loans for Entrepreneurs (MILE) program provides interest-free loans to early stage businesses developing or producing high-tech products or services in Minnesota. This program is an initiative of the Minnesota Investment Fund.
Innovation Voucher Program
This program provides up to $25,000 in financing to help small businesses purchase technical assistance and services necessary to advance research, development or commercialization of new or innovative products and services.
Minnesota 21st Century Fund
This fund makes loans or equity investments in innovative mineral, steel, or other industry processing, production, manufacturing, or technology projects located in the taconite relief tax area.
For More Information
Some incentives are offered by state government, some by local governments or other authorities. Generally, state incentives are tied to wage and job creation goals, and companies must enter into a formal business subsidy agreement to be eligible.
For more information on any of these programs, or to see if your project qualifies, contact our Location and Expansion Assistance Specialists.
Learn More about financing programs in Minnesota.


Worker Training
Minnesota Job Skills Partnership Program
The program partners strategically with businesses and schools to train or retrain workers, expand opportunities, and keep high-quality jobs in the state. Grants of up to $400,000 are awarded to educational institutions that partner with businesses to develop new-job training or retraining for existing employees. Training grants are offered in five different program areas.
Scitechsperience Internship Program
SciTechsperience is a paid internship program that connects college students in science, technology, engineering and math disciplines with rewarding hands-on opportunities at Minnesota companies that need their skills.

Bioscience Incentive Program 
The program provides production payments to encourage commercial-scale production of advanced biofuels, renewable chemicals, and thermal energy production from biomass. Learn more.


Foreign Trade
Foreign Trade Zones are commerce sites (industrial sites, buildings) set up in or near U.S. Customs ports of entry where merchandise is considered legally outside U.S. Customs territory. The zones are operated as public utilities by states, port authorities, other political groups, or corporations charted by the state.
Companies can use foreign trade zones to reduce duty payments, streamline supply chain costs and improve your competitive position in domestic and foreign markets.
There are eight General Purpose Zone sites in Minnesota, including six in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area (FTZ#119), one site in Duluth (FTZ#51), and one site in International Falls (FTZ#259). Individual companies may apply to the U.S. Department of Commerce to designate an area of their facility as a Subzone. This situation is ideal for companies too far from a General Purpose Zone.
EB-5 Investor Program 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Citizenship and Immigration Services division (USCIS) administers the Immigrant Investor Program, also known as EB-5.
The program is intended to stimulate the U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by offering foreign investors a permanent resident visa for investing $1 million (or at least $500,000 in a Targeted Employment Area) and creating or preserving at least 10 jobs for U.S. workers.


Infrastructure
Greater Minnesota Public Infrastructure Grant Program
Greater Minnesota Public Infrastructure Grant Program provides grants to cities of up to 50 percent of the capital costs of the public infrastructure necessary to expand or retain jobs in the area, increase the tax base, or expand or create new economic development.

Quality of Life Images

The happiest - and least stressed - state
People sometimes hesitate to move to Minnesota - but once they do, they tend to stay. Businesses here recognize that having good quality of life is important in attracting and retaining talent.

Across the state, our premier education and health care systems have led to a population of residents who are among the most educated and healthiest in the country. We rank first in the percentage of the population with a high school degree or above (2017).


For the past 28 years, Minnesota has ranked among the top 10 healthiest states in the country and placed first or second more than 10 times in America's Health Rankings (United Health Foundation).

Minnesota tops many other livability rankings as well. Here are just a few:

Happiest State in the U.S. (MagnifyMoney, 2018)
Least Stressed State in the Country (WalletHub, 2018)
2nd in Quality of Life (U.S. News & World Report, 2018)
3rd in Quality of Life (Forbes, 2018)
3rd in Quality of Life (CNBC, 2018)
4th in home ownership (U.S. Census Bureau, 2017)

Cost of Living
Whether you’re living in the Twin Cities, other Minnesota cities or in a smaller town or rural area, housing prices help make Minnesota an affordable place to live well – particularly when compared to locations on the coasts.

Work-life balance
Minnesota is a family-friendly place that values the importance of work-life balance:

Best State to Raise a Family (WalletHub, 2019)
Best State for Women (WalletHub, 2018)
2nd Best State for Working Moms and Working Dads (WalletHub, 2018)
3rd in America's Best States to Live In (CNBC, 2018)
4th in Overall Child Well-Being (2018 Kids Count Data Book, Annie E. Casey Foundation)

Living options

Minneapolis and St. Paul's downtown's support a mix of corporate, residential, retail and entertainment spaces that give each city a unique and vivacious spirit. Outside of the each city's center, residential neighborhoods provide a variety of living options. 


Tying together the Twin Cities urban environment is a flourishing public transit system of buses and light rail. For those who prefer to use their own two wheels, there are over 225 miles of on- and off-street bike paths running through Minneapolis alone, which would explain its frequent inclusion in lists of the most bike-friendly cities.


For those looking to live outside of the Twin Cities, Minnesota is full of charming small- and medium-sized cities with thriving and emerging economic opportunities – and affordable costs of living. Rochester, Duluth, St. Cloud and Moorhead are just a few examples of smaller metropolitan centers, each with a diverse economy and many of the cultural amenities that are found in the Twin Cities.

Optimizing Our Natural Resources
A unique combination of resources, expertise and supportive public policy makes Minnesota a top location for clean technologies and renewable energy industries.
With more than 10,000 lakes, we appreciate the importance of water and other natural resources. In fact, we’re home to many of the world’s largest water and wastewater technology companies. Minnesota is also recognized nationwide as a leading producer of biofuels and has seen triple-digit growth in solar jobs in recent years. We rank 7th nationwide in installed wind capacity.
 







Water Technology


We're global leaders in treatment, filtration, pumping and aeration.

  



Biofuels and Biomaterials


Powering the future with cleaner gasoline, biodiesel and greener renewable products.

  



Solar Energy


There's a sunny future for our growing solar industry.

  
 




Wind Energy


Minnesota is one of the top-rated states for installed wind capacity.

                    Information Technology
                
            
        

Minnesota has a rich history of computer industry development. A number of early industry leaders – such as Control Data Corporation – were based here.
Today, information technology companies operate statewide in industries ranging from manufacturing and retail sales to software development and IT services.
Electronics retail giant Best Buy is headquartered here. While large IT-reliant companies like 3M, UnitedHealth Group and Medtronic thrive here, so do small IT-focused startups.
Talent Makes Things Happen
We have a skilled and educated workforce – and promote our talent pipeline. In 2015-2016, there were 3,728 degrees in IT-related fields awarded by Minnesota post-secondary institutions. Minnesota ranks 4th in Technology and Science Workforce (Milken Institute) and 5th in Technology and Innovation (CNBC).
Information technology and telecommunications industries in Minnesota employed 135,983 people in 2017 – up 12 percent since 2010. These industries had 10,516 business establishments in 2017.
IT employees are attracted to Minnesota by the quality of life (ranked No. 1 by Forbes, 2017) and by our affordable cost of living.
Average earnings in IT and telecommunications are competitive compared to other high-tech states and the nation:

National average: $120,650
California: $169,462
Massachusetts: $155,744
Washington: $153,768
Illinois: $113,043
Minnesota: $106,143

(Source: EMSI, based on the Purdue definition of Information Technology and Telecommunications)
Minnesota’s IT firms are attractive to investors. Information technology received 48 percent of the $495 million Minnesota received in venture capital investments in 2017, according to the PwC/CB Insights MoneyTreeTM Report.
IT Companies
Many companies with IT-related products and services are headquartered in Minnesota or have major operations here. Just a handful of examples:

Manufacturers such as 3M, Honeywell, Polar Semiconductor, SkyWater Technology Foundry
Software, custom software and IT service providers such as Ceridian Corp, Code 42, Coherent Solutions, Digital River and Lawson Software
Telecommunications and Internet service providers such as Arvig, AT&T, CenturyLink, Frontier Communications, Sprint and Verizon
Data centers such as Cologix, DataBank, IronGate and Stream
Retailers and wholesalers of electronic equipment and supplies such as Best Buy and Digi-Key

Minnesota’s IT firms are attractive to investors. Information technology received 48 percent of the $495 million Minnesota received in venture capital investments in 2017, according to the PwC/CB Insights MoneyTreeTM Report.
The state of Minnesota offers various incentives and assistance to help entrepreneurs and startups.

Work hard, innovate harder
Minnesota’s booming economy has created a windfall of diverse, well-paying jobs with nearly every major industry represented. We attract people from all over the world; they come here to find work or to get an education that will prepare them for the many opportunities Minnesota offers. Couples with dual careers can each find rewarding jobs in their field.
Names You Know
Minnesota is home to 19 Fortune 500 companies (the 3rd most per capita) with recognizable names such as 3M, Target and General Mills - all known for their innovative contributions to society and progressive corporate cultures. There are also thousands of small- to medium-sized employers across the state that are the lifeblood of Minnesota’s economy, doing equally innovative work in health care, technology and professional services including law, advertising and much more.
Innovation: More than a buzzword
Minnesotans are known for being creative, inventive and entrepreneurial. We rank:

1st in medical device and food patents per capita
4th in the number of patents per capita

We tend to have a practical, we-can-do-it attitude to problem solving. This is part of what has enabled companies that start here to grow into business giants – and why we have thriving emerging clusters in areas such as fintech, Internet of Things and water technology.
Minnesota's business environment and workforce have garnered these recent national rankings: 

1st in Main Street Entrepreneurship, larger states (The 2016 Kauffman Index)
2nd Best State Overall (U.S. News & World Report, 2018)
3rd Best State for Millennials (WalletHub, 2018)
3rd in 5-Year Business Survival Rate (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013-2018)
3rd in Opportunity (U.S. News & World Report, 2018)
6th in America’s Top States for Business (CNBC, 2018)
7th in Technology and Science Workforce (Milken Institute 2018 State Technology and Science Index)

Minneapolis-St. Paul was ranked 3rd among the Top 10 U.S. Cities for Entrepreneurs and Start-Ups in 2018 by Business.org.
We invite you to join us here in the North. You’ll find plenty of opportunity.

Renewable Energy

Minnesota ranked ninth among all states on Site Selection’s 2017 Sustainability ranking. This index balances a number of factors comprising clean tech and green industry activity and potential, energy awareness, the built environment, redevelopment of polluted sites, policy, and human well-being and quality of life.

Minnesota is one of the top states in wind energy, according to the American Wind Energy Association, ranking seventh nationwide in wind installed capacity.  Eighteen percent of the energy produced in Minnesota is generated by wind, enough to power 1,012,000 homes.

As far as new solar energy installations, Minnesota ranked fourth in Q. 1, 2017, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The state ranks fourth in ethanol production capacity – with 1.3 billion gallons in 2018 – and fourth in operating production, according to the Renewable Fuels Association.

The Minnesota Department of Commerce also offers information and assistance about clean energy technologies. Contact the Energy Information Center for more information: Department of Commerce
Telecommunications
Minnesota has a reliable network of telecommunication providers and solid infrastructure to support business success. In addition to broadband and internet services, Minnesota's telecommunications include transmission services using wired, wireless and satellite infrastructure.
The Department of Commerce represents consumer interests in all aspects of the regulatory process to ensure that reliable telecommunications services are provided to all at reasonable rates.

Minnesota ranks first in Internet usage (National Telecommunications & Information Administration, 2016) and seventh in Internet access (U.S. News & World Report).

Border-to-border high speed Internet access is the goal throughout Minnesota, which is heavily connected to fiber, cable, DSL and wireless broadband networks. Since 2014, the state has invested more than $85 million toward enhancing broadband infrastructure – leveraging another $111 million in private investments.

The Minnesota Broadband Office connects communities, policymakers, providers, regional support organizations, and state and federal programs with each other and the resources they need to improve broadband access and use in Minnesota.

Expertise ... Experience ...Talent
Minnesota has the deep bench of professional expertise and a regularly refreshed pool of new talent that every data center needs to succeed.
About 480 data processing, hosting and related establishments (NAICS 5182) employ 7,130 workers statewide. Nearly 90 percent are in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. In fact, employment in data processing hosting and related services in Minneapolis-St. Paul is 52% more concentrated than the national average as indicated by the area's location quotient (1.52).
Special incentives, lower business taxes, lower energy costs, top-shelf infrastructure and a highly skilled workforce make it more attractive than ever to build data and network operation centers in Minnesota. Read our Fact Sheet on Data Centers.

                    Internet of Things
                
            
        

Minnesota has remarkable strength in the fast-emerging area of Internet of Things (IoT), which combines multiple technologies and cuts across industry sectors.

We’re ideally suited for this role because of our long tradition as an electronics and computer leader. Early computer giants (such as Control Data Corp.) got their start here. This region became known as Medical Alley for its pioneering role in medical device technology. And it also been a leader in industrial data collection and control with firms such as Honeywell, Rosemount and Eaton.

An Innovative Patent Powerhouse
Minnesota’s creative and innovative streak is reflected in our patent rankings. We’re:


1st in the number of medical device patents per capita
1st worldwide in the number of patents in medical device light, thermal and electrical applications between 2011 and 2015
8th nationwide in electrical computers, digital processing systems and related patents (based on a grouping of more than 20 technology classes) between 1996 and 2016

(Source: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, most recent available data as of May 2018)

We rank in the top 10 for technology and innovation:


5th in Technology and Innovation (CNBC, 2017)
7th in Technology and Sciences Business Strength (Milken Institute 2016 State Technology and Science Index)
9th Most Innovative State (Bloomberg, 2016)


Our Fast-Growing IoT Community
Minnesota’s IoT community is connected and growing quickly. For instance, IoTFuse, a non-profit based in Minneapolis, organizes regular meetups, hackathons and an annual conference. Its Meetup.com group reaches over 1,800 members and meets monthly to talk about a wide range of IoT topics. The annual IoTFuse Conference attracts over 1,000 attendees and over 60 speakers.

Minnesota also has an active analytics cluster. MinneAnalytics, a non-profit that serves Minnesota’s data science and analytics community, is the nation’s largest community-driven data analytics group. 

Tech entrepreneurs can get feedback on their innovations through competitions such as MN Cup – the largest statewide innovation competition in the country – and the Tekne Awards. 

There are dozens of conferences, innovation accelerators, meetups, hackathons and startup support groups. 

Local entrepreneur associations, angel investor groups and accelerators are devoted to helping innovators bring their ideas to fruition. 

Large corporations – such as Target, Land O’Lakes and Honeywell – are partnering with innovative startups. Out-of-state and foreign direct investment also play an important role.

The state of Minnesota offers a Research and Development Tax Credit and other incentives and assistance to help entrepreneurs and startups.
