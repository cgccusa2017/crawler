5 things to know about the first biochemical production tax credit














Last year Iowa passed its Renewable Chemicals Production Tax Credit, which the USDA has called the “strongest” incentive for the biobased chemical industry.

July 25, 2017




Last year Iowa passed its Renewable Chemicals Production Tax Credit, which the USDA has called the “strongest” incentive for the biobased chemical industry.
The program allocates $100 million in tax credits over ten years to be applied to the manufacturing of 40 key building block chemicals.  Here are five quick things to know about the Renewable Chemicals Production Tax Credit program.

No other state has an incentive like this

The program offers tax credits equal to 5 cents per pound of qualified chemicals produced, and the state will have the authority to grant up to $10 million in tax relief annually. A 2016 USDA report, “A Economic Impact Analysis of the U.S. Biobased Products Industry,” says Iowa’s Renewable Chemicals Production Tax Credit program, “represents the strongest existing incentive package for the global biobased chemical industry.”

It’s not for food, feed or fuel

Products eligible under this program must not be primarily used for food, feed or fuel. However, food additives may be eligible.


Iowa has the infrastructure and raw materials in place for advanced bioprocessing

Iowa has a network of more than 50 bioprocessing sites and one of the nation’s highest amounts of harvestable biomass. In addition, the state’s robust transportation infrastructure provides easy access to national and international markets.

Bioprocessing research is concentrated in Iowa

Iowa is home to the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Biorenewable Chemicals led by Iowa State University (ISU), the ISU BioCentury Research Farm and the University of Iowa’s Bioeconomy Institute. With these essential pieces already in place, the passing of this bill further cements Iowa’s position as an innovative leader in a growing industry that accounts for more $250 billion in revenue and thousands of jobs each year.

This is a tax credit built on a stable foundation

The legislation creating the Renewable Tax Credit Program passed the Iowa State Senate 46-3 and the House 95-1, indicating its broad support, and demonstrating how businesses in Iowa benefit from fair and consistent government.
For more information on this tax credit program and doing business in Iowa, visit iowaeconomicdevelopment.com/bioproducts.

We’re all about that balance














In Iowa, we’re big on work/life balance. After the workday’s over, we hop in our cars and enjoy one of the shortest commutes in the country -- at just 19.4 minutes.

March 21, 2019




In Iowa, we’re big on work/life balance. After the workday’s over, we hop in our cars and enjoy one of the shortest commutes in the country -- at just 19.4 minutes.
Know what that means? We get more “me” time, whether we’re hitting up the links, riding the trails or enjoying dinner at one of our James Beard-nominated restaurants. In fact, Iowa was named the eighth best state for work/life balance by FitSmallBusiness.com - in part due to low commute times and high quality of life.
Just ask Sherri Hotzler, president and CEO of Vantec, Inc., a world leader in custom plastic injection molding services. Said Hotzler, “Operating a company in Iowa allows you to reach your goals and grow your business without sacrificing a personal life.”
In her personal life, Hotzler is a marathon runner. “I try to maximize my time when I travel for business,” said Hotzler, “and running marathons has afforded me great personal satisfaction, a healthy outlet for stress and provided countless business connections.”
And since Iowa’s short commute gives her an extra hour of free time each day, she has more opportunity to enjoy the activities she loves, like running. If running isn’t your thing, that’s okay. Iowa offers all kinds of hobbies for you to enjoy. Like hiking or biking our 2,000 miles of trails. Or practicing your golf swing.
After all, Iowa has more nine-hole golf courses per capita than any other state. We also have nationally ranked arts festivals and farmers’ markets. And you can take in a touring Broadway show at a fraction of the price you’d pay in bigger cities. There’s no doubt that Iowans really do benefit from our amazing work/life balance, which in turn benefits Iowa businesses.
It’s like Sherri Hotzler says, “Iowa’s balanced lifestyle results in quality worker performance and gives us a competitive edge.”

Global startups enter insurtech accelerator














Central Iowa's insurtech accelerator is a global draw.

March 29, 2017




Now in its third year, Insurance Journal writes that the Global Insurance Accelerator in Des Moines is experiencing a “growth-spurt.” The accelerator has seen an increase in the number of applications, with more from mature companies. Four of the six participants in this year’s accelerator class have marketable products and two are at the early concept stage.
The Global Insurance Accelerator is a 100-day program where six startups with products for the insurance industry accelerate their companies’ development. During the 100 days, the entrepreneurs have direct access to more than 25 insurance companies in the Des Moines area and one-on-one mentorship with more than 60 insurance industry professionals. Each startup also receives $40,000 in seed investment.
The accelerator’s focus on one of central Iowa’s industry strengths has made it a worldwide draw – the six startups in this year’s class are from Arizona, Canada, Germany, Massachusetts, Michigan and Serbia. The Des Moines area has one of the highest concentrations of finance and insurance companies in the country, many of which sponsor the accelerator.
Read the full article here, “Mentor-Driven Global Insurance Accelerator Is Enjoying its Own Growth-Spurt,” Insurance Journal, March 6, 2017.

Bioscience Thrives in Iowa














It’s an exciting time for bioscience in Iowa. In July, Des Moines will host the 2019 BIO World Congress on Industrial Biotechnology.

January 31, 2019




It’s an exciting time for bioscience in Iowa. In July, Des Moines will host the 2019 BIO World Congress on Industrial Biotechnology — the first time this event has been held outside of the coasts or Canada. BIO attendees may be pleasantly surprised to learn Iowa is much more than cornfields and midwestern values. 
Iowa has earned its reputation as a bioscience epicenter with a continuous focus on innovation and collaboration, leveraging unique research and development strengths in four bioscience platforms in particular: biobased chemicals, medical devices, precision and digital agriculture, and vaccines and immunotherapy. 
The state is home to the second-most acres of harvestable biomass. Forty-three processing facilities in Iowa produce more than one-quarter of U.S. ethanol, and 12 refineries produce 16 percent of U.S. biodiesel. The state’s legislature created America’s first Renewable Chemical Production Tax Credit in 2016, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture calls the “strongest existing incentive package for the global biobased chemical industry.”
A Business-Friendly Environment
With an eye to sustained growth, state leaders have long valued the importance of a business-friendly regulatory environment. As a result, each of the state’s core strength sectors — wind energy, renewable biofuels, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing and food manufacturing — have benefited from a low cost of doing business, tax incentives, advanced and easy-to-access infrastructure and continued support from a pro-business state government.
A Skilled and Motivated Workforce
Iowa has ramped up its STEM education — Iowa colleges and universities award more than 2,000 bioscience degrees each year. And, it’s why Iowa's bioscience workforce has grown to be one of the best in the nation. Iowa is a bioscience leader, and its residents know how to get the job finished.
One of America’s preeminent agricultural research institutions, Iowa State University, is based in Ames, Iowa. Ames is also home to the National Science Foundation’s Engineering Research Center for Biorenewable Chemicals (CBiRC) and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Ames Laboratory.
Iowa’s appeal to its workforce isn’t all about business. Iowans — both native and new — enjoy a quality of life that offers balance between career goals and an active family life. U.S. News & World Report also ranked Iowa as No. 1 in infrastructure, No. 3 in healthcare and No. 5 in education — all of which contributed to the state being named the magazine’s No. 1 state in the nation in 2018.

Bloomberg: Iowa has the cleanest power














Iowa is the state which generates the highest share of its electricity from wind and solar.

December 7, 2017




Bloomberg recently reported that while states such as California have ambitious renewable energy goals, Iowa is the state which generates the highest share of its electricity from wind and solar.
Iowa is also the easiest state in the country for companies to purchase renewable energy. In addition, Iowa has the country’s most reliable electric grid, and some of the nation’s lowest energy prices. The availability of affordable, ample and reliable wind energy in Iowa is a major reason tech companies including Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft are investing billions in wind-powered facilities in the Hawkeye State.
Surprised? Find out more about Iowa’s renewable energy leadership at iowaeconomicdevelopment.com/wind.
Read the full Bloomberg article here, “California Is Plenty Green But Iowa Has the Cleanest Power.”

The Main Street Approach as a Catalyst for Revitalization














In Iowa, successful communities have learned to balance historic preservation, creativity, business support and organizational basics. Greenfield is a prime example of a community that has embraced change and is experiencing a rural revitalization.

February 4, 2019




The start of a new year is a time for thinking ahead. It is a time to set the tone for what you want to achieve in the coming months. This same consideration can be applied to communities all across Iowa. At the start of the New Year, cities and towns can examine where they are economically and what they want to accomplish in the future. A downtown or commercial district represents a community’s history and helps define the community. A downtown is also a major economic driver that attracts visitors, businesses and commerce.
Downtown revitalization is often a top goal for cities and towns. The acceptance of a community’s progression over time becomes an often-overlooked element of a revitalization process. Too many times, we use the memory of the past as our vision for the future. This becomes a roadblock as a place begins its revitalization process. The reality is that downtown will be different in the future. That change will welcome new types of businesses, new uses for downtown spaces and new faces as leaders. The acceptance of change can be one of the most difficult elements when working with a place, but, like a grieving process, we must learn to accept that the old "us" is gone before we can be open to the idea that the new "us" will be different. Different in new, exciting ways that will position our downtowns to thrive in the next chapter of our community’s evolution.
In Iowa, successful communities have learned to balance historic preservation, creativity, business support and organizational basics. There are many examples of communities throughout Iowa that have successfully completed downtown revitalization projects. These stories demonstrate a diverse urban program utilizing community-initiated development and a successful traditional retail district. Not only do downtown projects have an impact on the physical appearance of a town, but also have a huge economic impact.
Greenfield, Iowa is a prime example of a community that has embraced change and is experiencing a rural revitalization. Greenfield is the prototypical rural, county-seat downtown. With its central, tree-lined courthouse square, intact one to three story early 20th century commercial buildings and locally-owned businesses, downtown Greenfield is an intimate historic district. Dominated by the grand E.E. Warren Opera House, the downtown had seen its better days upon the community entering the Main Street program in 1995.
The revitalization of the long vacant opera house was a primary goal of the local Main Street program, and eventually gave way to the Warren Cultural Center, which opened in 2012. The community was able to diversify its use of space and sources of income to be more financially sustainable. The size, scale and sophistication of this amazing project provided the opportunity for the community and region to experience how Greenfield was not going to let major challenges stand in the way of a bright future. Greenfield demonstrated the payoff of an incremental process paired with a bold vision for the new chapter of downtown. As a result of their efforts, Greenfield has seen both businesses and foot traffic increase in the downtown area.
Greenfield has shown how communities can promote change and the ability to meet the unique and different needs of individuals using downtown spaces. Communities across the state have followed Greenfield’s example and completed projects of their own to revitalize their city centers and drive economic activity. Communities that have been a part of the Main Street Iowa program have experienced significant impacts that include:

Creating more than 4,000 downtown businesses employing an additional 12,000 people
Assisting in nearly 15,000 building improvement projects that have leveraged over $1.7 billion in private investment

If downtown development or downtown revitalization is not an active segment of your community’s goals for 2019, your efforts may be incomplete. By acknowledging that revitalization is more than simply driving change but also about supporting the personal connections to a place, local leaders can use the emotional connections relating to change as an empowerment tool. This can position a local revitalization program to be more engaged through honest conversations with the community about the impacts of change. It can also give a place permission to celebrate the past in a different way, to build acceptance that the new version of who we are going to be is different, and that is not only okay, it’s exciting.

Iowa receives “A” for manufacturing industry health














Iowa has one of the healthiest manufacturing industries in the country, according to a new report.

July 13, 2017





Iowa has one of the healthiest manufacturing industries in the country, according to a new report from Ball State University and Conexus Indiana.
Iowa received an “A” rating from the report, with especially high marks for the abilities of Iowa’s manufacturing workforce, which the report notes is the most important factor for manufacturers. The researchers gave Iowa an “A” in the “Human Capital,” a grade which takes the following criteria into account:
Our human capital measurements include rankings of educational attainment at the high school and collegiate level, the first-year retention rate of adults in community and technical colleges, the number of associates degrees awarded annually on a per capita basis, and the share of adults enrolled in adult basic education.
Iowa has the highest public high school graduation rates in the country, and increasing levels of post-secondary education is one of the state’s priorities.
