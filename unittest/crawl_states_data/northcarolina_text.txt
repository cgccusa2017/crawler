              Unemployment Insurance            

 














What is unemployment insurance tax?
As an employer, you pay Unemployment Insurance (UI) tax on your payrolls.  This UI tax pays for the benefits that are paid to qualified, unemployed workers. Unemployment tax is not deducted from employee wages.
N.C. Commerce's Division of Employment Security transfers unemployment tax payments made by employers to the federal Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund in Washington, D.C. Each year, a prorated share of the interest earned on this trust fund is added back to the account of each North Carolina employer having a credit experience rating balance.

              Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG)            

 














The Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) is a performance-based, discretionary incentive program that provides cash grants directly to a company, when the company creates jobs and invests in the state.  Grants are awarded only in competitive recruitment or retention situations.  JDIG grants hold companies to strict performance targets, but the grants can signifigantly help offset the cost of locating or expanding a facility in the state.
Grant payments are paid annually over time, for terms of up to 12 years, following a yearly, rigorous performance review conducted by the Departments of Commerce and Revenue.
 JDIG awards are calculated by weighing a number of factors, including:
The location of the project
The county tier designation - more on the state's economic tier system can be reviewed here.
The number of net new jobs created in North Carolina
The wages of the jobs, compared to the given county average wage
The level of investment made in the state
The company's industry sector, and that industry's alignment with the state’s targeted industry sectors.
JDIG grant payments are determined using a formula that takes into consideration the new taxes generated by the new jobs that are created.  A percentage of those newly generated funds are reimbursed to the awarded company, for the limited term of the grant and as long as the company meets its performance target.

              GoldenLEAF Infrastructure Grants            

 














The Golden LEAF Foundation, a North Carolina grant-making organization, will consider applications to assist eligible state, regional and local economic development entities with grants to support permissible activities in projects in which a company will commit to create a specific number of full time jobs in a tobacco-dependent or economically distressed area. Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact Golden LEAF staff to discuss the potential projects and conditions that may be applicable prior to submitting an application.
Economic Catalyst Program Guidelines:
Eligible applicants are governmental entities and 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organizations.
Applications in this program must be for projects that will lead to job creation by a company that will commit to create the jobs if Golden LEAF provides a grant for the project.
Competitive applications will include information showing that the expected job creation is AT RISK without Golden LEAF support. An applicant can demonstrate that a project is AT RISK by identifying a funding gap that exists that would significantly impair the applicant’s ability to attract the anticipated jobs if Golden LEAF does not make a grant for the project.
Examples of other factors that may be considered to determine whether a project is AT RISK without Golden LEAF support include:
evidence of urgency for financial assistance necessary to facilitate job creation;
whether local governments have provided support for the project at levels that are appropriate in light of available resources. (Golden LEAF funds will not be available to satisfy shortfalls resulting from local policies limiting local support for a project.); and
whether the applicant has secured or attempted to secure funding for the project from other sources such as the State of North Carolina, the North Carolina Department of Commerce, EDA, ARC, and others.
Proposals for Economic Catalyst grants should be coordinated with the other economic development entities, including:
North Carolina Department of Commerce,
the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina and
local and regional economic development organizations.
Grants are available only for projects that include a specific company’s commitment to create full-time jobs in NC. Full-time jobs are defined as jobs that provide 1,600 hours or more per year of work. Companies must provide at least 50% of the cost of employee-only health insurance for full-time employees.
The Golden LEAF Foundation will consider at least the following factors when determining whether to fund a project and at what level:
the economic distress of the community in which the jobs would be created,
the number of jobs to be created,
the quality of jobs to be created, measured by factors including wages paid and skill levels involved.
Examples of other factors Golden LEAF may consider when determining the amount and availability of funding for a project include:
the economic impact of project, including costs and benefits to the state;
the strategic importance of the project to the state, region, or community;
the importance of the industry to the state, region, and community;
the quality and viability of the company that will create the jobs assessed by factors including how long the company has been in operation and its financial success;
the Golden LEAF grant will address needs that are directly related to job creation from the project;
there is competition for the project with a site outside North Carolina;
Golden LEAF support will also help avoid imminent job losses.
Economically distressed or tobacco-dependent communities that are located in high wealth counties may make the case for support because the project will be located in a low-wealth area or an area with negative trends in employment, income, poverty, or similar factors.
Applicants must identify specific charitable, educational, or scientific uses for Golden LEAF funds, as defined by Section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, that are directly related to the project. Golden LEAF may require the applicant to demonstrate that the company that will commit to create the promised jobs is obligated to repay a pro rata amount of the grant if there are job creation shortfalls. Examples of eligible projects include:
Funding to help with the delivery of training programs offered by eligible entities, typically the local community college.
Golden LEAF funds are usually used for acquisition of training equipment or construction/renovation of space needed to provide the training.
Training must be available to the public and be for transferable skills.
Golden LEAF funds may be used in conjunction with, but not to displace training funds available through other sources such as the NC Community College System.
When Golden LEAF funds are used for costs associated with job training, Golden LEAF will typically require evidence of an inducement agreement demonstrating that the company is obligated to meet the job creation projections and wage goals, and providing appropriate consequences should the company fail to satisfy its obligations; however, Golden LEAF usually does not require a clawback specifically for the Golden LEAF grant funds.

Funding for costs associated with public infrastructure improvements, such as water and sewer, that are needed for the project.
Golden LEAF funds may not be used for construction of infrastructure on private property or for privately owned infrastructure;
When Golden LEAF funds are used for infrastructure costs, Golden LEAF will typically require evidence of an inducement agreement demonstrating that the company is obligated to meet the job creation projections and wage goals, and providing appropriate consequences should the company fail to satisfy its obligations; however, Golden LEAF usually does not require a clawback specifically for the Golden LEAF grant funds.

Funds for purchase of equipment to be owned by the grantee and leased to the business at a rate that allows recovery of the full cost of the equipment plus interest at the IRS-determined Applicable Federal Rate over the life of the lease.
Golden LEAF will approve the terms of the lease for the equipment.
In projects such as these, Golden LEAF will typically require the business to pay an increased lease rate as a penalty if the company fails to create the promised jobs.

Economic Catalyst proposals may be submitted throughout the year and will be presented to the Golden LEAF Foundation Board at the next regularly scheduled meeting that is not less than six weeks after submission of the completed proposal. The proposal may be submitted at an earlier Board meeting if Golden LEAF is able to complete its review of the proposal prior to the meeting. Applicants should inform Golden LEAF if their projects are urgent and should specifically identify the reason for the urgency.
Golden LEAF is subject to North Carolina’s Open Meetings laws and the North Carolina Public Records Act. Please follow the link below for more details regarding how those laws affect Golden LEAF and its review of certain economic development projects and the circumstances under information may be kept confidential.
How to Apply
Only 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations and governmental entities may apply.

              Community Housing Grants            

 


















Neighborhood Revitalization | Federal CDBG


Neighborhood Revitalization | Federal CDBG
The North Carolina Neighborhood Revitalization Program (NC Neighborhood) will offer a non-entitlement municipality or county the opportunity to tailor a project to meet the community development needs specific and most critical to their locality, primarily for their low- and moderate-income residents. The NC Neighborhood Program incorporates several previous Rural Economic Development Division (REDD) Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) programs and activities such as Scattered Site Housing and Supportive Housing.
North Carolina received approximately $45 million in CDBG funds for 2018. Of this amount, approximately $10 million will be made available for the NC Neighborhood Program.  The state makes these funds available through awarding grants to non-entitlement governments throughout North Carolina. 
The NC Neighborhood Program will support the three livability principles that helps guide sustainability and resiliency throughout areas that receive funding. Regardless of the program activity or activities local governments pursue, NC Neighborhood Program projects must incorporate at least one of the following three livability principles as an area of focus:
Promote equitable, affordable housing. Expand location and energy-efficient housing choices for people of all ages, incomes, races, and ethnicities to increase mobility and lower the combined cost of housing and transportation.
Support existing communities.  Target federal funding toward existing communities - through strategies like transit-oriented, mixed-use development, and land recycling - to increase community revitalization and the efficiency of public works investments and safeguard rural landscapes.
Value communities and neighborhoods.  Enhance the unique characteristics of all communities by investing in health, safe, and walkable neighborhoods - rural, urban, or suburban.
Eligible Applicants
All municipalities are eligible to receive State CDBG funds except for entitlement communities, which receive funds directly from HUD.  North Carolina's 24 entitlement municipalities are:  Asheville, Burlington, Cary, Chapel Hill, Charlotte, Concord, Durham, Fayetteville, Gastonia, Goldsboro, Greensboro, Greenville, Hickory, High Point, Jacksonville, Kannapolis, Lenoir, Morganton, New Bern, Raleigh, Rocky Mount, Salisbury, Wilmington, and Winston-Salem. 
In addition, all counties are eligible to receive State CDBG funds except Mecklenburg County, Wake County, Union, and Cumberland County, which have been designated by HUD as urban entitlement counties.  As entitlement counties, neither the counties nor their municipalities are eligible for Small Cities funding, except for the towns of Holly Springs and Linden.
Housing Activities 
Funds for the housing category may be spent on rehabilitation, acquisition, clearance, relocation, substantial rehabilitation, replacement housing and emergency repairs. Please see 24 CFR 570.201 for a complete list of eligible housing activities.
There are no project boundaries for any of the activities in the housing category.  The applicant may choose to do scattered site housing or housing in a concentrated area or a combination.  There is no limit on the number of houses or the number of activities for the project.  The applicant will need to decide how many houses can be treated during the 30-month grant period. 


Neighborhood Stabilization | Federal CDBG


Neighborhood Stabilization | Federal CDBG
Background
The U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) allocated $3.92 billion to all states and particularly hard-hit areas trying to respond to the effects of high foreclosures. HUD's new Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) will provide targeted emergency assistance through HUD's Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA). These targeted funds will be used to purchase foreclosed homes at a discount and to rehabilitate or redevelop them in order to respond to rising foreclosures and falling home values. 
Neighborhood stabilization funds may be used for activities which include, but are not limited to:

acquiring land and property


demolishing or rehabilitating abandoned properties


offering down-payment and closing-cost assistance to low- to moderate-income homebuyers


creating "land banks" to assemble, temporarily manage, and dispose of vacant land for the purpose of stabilizing neighborhoods and encouraging re-use or redevelopment of urban property

Eligible entities include entitlement cities and non-entitlement counties in target areas, non-profits, community development corporations, councils of government, public housing authorities, and public finance agencies. 
Information for NSP 3- Substantial Amendment:
The State of North Carolina received an allocation of $5 million in the newly-authorized third round of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP3), which was provided under Section 1497 of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). This substantial amendment outlines the expected distribution and use of the state’s allocation. The public comment period has expired on the amended action plan. Contact Iris Payne for more information at ipayne@nccommerce.com.
NSP 1 Announcements and Past Grantees
RALEIGH, March 18, 2009 – Gov. Bev Perdue announced that 20 local governments, nonprofits and other organizations have received grant awards totaling $48.85 million under the new federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The program’s purpose is to assist those areas hit hardest by the housing crisis. 
	States were required to identify areas of greatest need based on the number of foreclosure starts and other housing-related statistics from state and national sources. In North Carolina, areas in 23 counties met the “greatest need” criteria: Alamance, Brunswick, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Catawba, Cumberland, Dare, Davidson, Durham, Edgecombe, Forsyth, Gaston, Guilford, Iredell, Johnston, Mecklenburg, New Hanover, Pitt, Randolph, Rowan, Union, Vance and Wake. 
Grantees
The NSP-1 grantees include: the cities of Charlotte, Durham, Gastonia, Greensboro, High Point, Lexington, Raleigh, and Rocky Mount; Wake and Vance counties; Forsyth County and City of Winston-Salem; the Housing Authorities of Charlotte and Greensboro; Habitat for Humanity of Forsyth County and Greater Greensboro; NC Community Development Initiative Capital, Inc.; NC Housing Finance Agency; Passage Home, Inc.; Center for Community Self-Help; and Saint Augustine’s University.  
	The NSP-3 grantees include: the cities of Durham, Gastonia, Raleigh and Rocky Mount; Builders of Hope, Inc.; and Passage Home, Inc.
Grantee Forms and Compliance Plans
For financial management documents go here. For requisitions not listed please contact tmoore@nccommerce.com.
Each grantee is required to have a Language Access Plan. Should grantees have any questions on how to complete the template or questions about complying with limited English proficiency, please contact your Grants Representative or compliance@nccommerce.com.

              Downtown Redevelopment - CDBG            

 















Fund Update - 8.2.2017
All available funds have been allocated. The Fund is currently suspended and not accepting applications. This page will be updated should additional monies become available.

Background
This fund is designed for infrastructure upgrades of downtown buildings in order to meet current code requirements. The upgrades should be for vacant or underutilized downtown commercial buildings. An underutilized building is defined as a property that is less than fully utilized or used below its potential. This fund is designed to return vacant or underutilized commercial buildings to economic use for new and/or expanded business. The goal of the fund is the prevention or elimination of urban blight.
 
A local government applicant must propose a project in conjunction with a private for profit business that proposes to renovate a vacant and/or underutilized downtown building for commercial or mixed-use development. This investment is intended to encourage job creation. In order to be eligible, documentation must be provided showing that the buildings(s) or specific project area(s) in an underutilized building(s) have been vacant thirty (30) days or more prior to the date of the pre-application conference. Funds are limited to a minimum of $300,000.00 and a maximum of $500,000.00 municipality.
Tier 1 communities are not required to match the funds. Communities located in tiers 2 and 3 have a 25% match. For every $1.00 of the Downtown Redevelopment Fund, there must be $0.25 in the form of cash of non-state or federal dollars used as match. Matching funds may come from building owners, local government or for-profit businesses. Match may be used for additional building infrastructure improvements and business up-fit including equipment purchases and upgrades. Evidence of commitment of all funding sources must be submitted at the time of application.

Infrastructure is critical to attracting companies and supporting expansion. North Carolina has mulitple resources to help communities invest in their utility and transportation infrastructue so they are better positioned to compete for business. 
State Rural Grants
Rural Grant Programs administers the Rural Building Reuse, Infrastructure and Demolition grant programs. These programs provide local governments with funds for critical infrastructure, building improvements, and demolition that will lead to the creation of new, full-time jobs. Please review our program information pages for additional details. 
Federal CDBG
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds are available to local municipal or county governments for projects to enhance the vitality of communities by providing decent housing and suitable living environments and expanding economic opportunities. These grants primarily serve persons of low- and moderate- incomes. State CDBG funds are provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to the state of North Carolina. Some urban counties and cities in North Carolina receive CDBG funding directly from HUD.

The Utility Account assists local governments in counties that have one of the 80 most distressed rankings under G.S. 143B-437.08 after adjustments are applied for creating jobs in eligible industries. Funds are provided as incentives for job creation and investment to benefit industries eligible to participate in the Article 3J tax credit program. 
GoldenLEAF Infrastructure Grants
Golden LEAF considers applications to assist eligible state, regional and local economic development entities with grants to support projects in which a company will commit to create a specific number of full-time jobs in a tobacco-dependent or economically distressed area. 
Rail Industrial Access Program
The North Carolina Department of Transportation’s (NCDOT) Rail Industrial Access Program uses state funds to help construct or refurbish railroad spur tracks needed by a new or expanding company.

              Rail Industrial Access Program            

 














The North Carolina Department of Transportation’s (NCDOT) Rail Industrial Access Program uses state funds to help construct or refurbish railroad spur tracks required by a new or expanding company. Program funding is intended to modernize railroad tracks to ensure effective and efficient freight deliveries.
Project funding is contingent upon a company’s receiving application approval prior to making a decision to locate or expand its facility in North Carolina. In addition, an award can be made only after confirmation of the availability of matching funds from private and/or local sources.
Local governments, community development agencies, railroads and companies themselves are eligible for funds to improve rail access. Approval depends on a variety of factors, including the number of potential new jobs that will be created, the amount of capital investment, rail use and local economic conditions.
Grant recipients may receive a maximum of 50% of total project costs, subject to a $200,000 limit per project. Program funding is an incentive to encourage companies to locate or expand in North Carolina versus another state. Projects considering in-state locations only or those not anticipated to yield a significant economic impact do not qualify for funding.
Eligible Use
Eligible project costs include:
Engineering and design
Site preparation, including grading and drainage
Track construction
Switches
Grade crossings and signals
Ineligible project costs include:
Relocation of utilities
Acquisition of right-of-way
Unloading facilities

              Downtown Development Funds            

 















North Carolina downtowns are the cultural and economic centers of their communities. When Main Streeet struggles, the community feels it; and when Main Street booms, the community thrives.
Main Street Solutions Fund
The Main Street Solutions Fund supports small businesses in designated micropolitans located in Tier 2 and Tier 3 counties or designated North Carolina Main Street communities. The grants  assist planning agencies and small businesses with efforts to revitalize downtowns by creating jobs, funding infrastructure improvements and rehabilitating buildings.
The Main Street Solutions Fund is just one part of the Main Street and Rural Planning Center at Commerce that provides strategic planning, implementation, technical assistance and guidance to small towns and rural areas throughout the state. 
Community Development Block Grant
Many downtowns are home to historic buildings that provide character and history. Major renovation is often needed to bring these buildings to code so they can be used safely. The federal funds from the Community Development Block Grant - Downtown Redevelopment program are designed to return vacant or underutilized commercial buildings to economic use for new and/or expanded business. Currently, the amount allotted to the State of North Carolina for this program has been disbursed to communities. This page will be updated and N.C. Commerce will contact communities should additional funds become available.

              Rapid Response - Support for Workers            

 














Rapid Response is an early intervention program that helps employers and workers facing layoffs, closures, and other sensitive business actions.
How Rapid Response Works
After a business files a WARN notice with the state, a Rapid Response team is deployed to help that company and the affected employees. Some of the reasons companies may file a WARN notice include the following:
Downsizing/restructuring
Federal action impacting defense, timber or fishing industries
Natural disasters
Plant relocations
Bankruptcy
A Rapid Response team will be deployed within 48 hours of the WARN notice being filed. The team will assess the situation and work with company officials to plan the most appropriate response. Rapid Response teams provide the following services to businesses:
Developing a transitional plan of action best suited to the workers of the affected business.
Distributing information on public services for job seekers.
Developing a plan to access funds and services for workers, including Trade Adjustment Assistance and Pell grants.
Reducing worker absenteeism to achieve completion of production.
Sharing experiences from handling previous closures and layoff events.
Providing convenient on-site services to ease the transition for workers.
Offering specialized assistance, such as job fairs, financial planning workshops, and interest/aptitude assessments or other specialized services.
For More Information
For more information about the Rapid Response program, contact the N.C. Division of Workforce Solutions at 800-562-6333 or 919-813-0323, or write:

              Appalachian Regional Commission Funds            

 














The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) is a unique federal-state partnership providing social and economic support for a 13-state region stretching along the Appalachian Mountains from southern New York to northern Mississippi.
	Established by the United States Congress in 1965, when Appalachia was considered "a region apart" from the rest of the nation, ARC has worked to bring Appalachia's 22 million people into America's economic mainstream.
	In North Carolina, ARC supports economic development activities in Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Cherokee, Clay, Davie, Forsyth, Graham, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Stokes, Surry, Swain, Transylvania, Watauga, Wilkes, Yadkin, and Yancey counties.
Each year ARC provides funding for projects throughout the Appalachian Region of North Carolina. Projects approved for ARC assistance must support one of the five general goals.
Goal 1: Economic Opportunities: Invest in entrepreneurial and business development strategies that strengthen Appalachia's economy.
Goal 2: Ready Workforce: Improve the education, knowledge, skills, and health of residents to work and succeed in Appalachia.
Goal 3: Critical Infrastructure: Invest in critical infrastructure—especially broadband; transportation, including the Appalachian Development Highway System; and water/wastewater systems.
Goal 4: Natural and Cultural Assets: Strengthen Appalachia's community and economic development potential by leveraging the Region's natural and cultural heritage assets.
Goal 5: Leadership and Community Capacity: Build the capacity and skills of current and next-generation leaders and organizations to innovate, collaborate, and advance community and economic development.
Eligible applicants are public entities (cities, towns, counties, regions, public service districts) and nonprofit organizations.

Enhancing local community housing and environments, expanding economic opportunities
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds are available to local municipal or county governments for projects to enhance the vitality of communities by providing decent housing and suitable living environments and expanding economic opportunities. These grants primarily serve persons of low- and moderate- incomes. State CDBG funds are provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to the state of North Carolina. Some urban counties and cities in North Carolina receive CDBG funding directly from HUD. CDBG Funds are used to spur economic developement for job creation and retention.
The economic development component of the CDBG Program is administered by the Rural Economic Development Division within the North Carolina Department of Commerce. CDBG Infrastructure funds are administered by the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality to assist with addressing environmental issues due to aging sewer systems, contaminated drinking water, and improve the quality of life for many citizens across the state because of improved systems. The North Carolina Division of Water Infrastructure provides financial assistance for projects that improve water quality.

              Employment Projections            

 














Every year, the North Carolina Department of Commerce studies national, statewide, and local economic trends to produce long-term and short-term employment projections for state and sub-state areas. Based on historical data, these projections provide a guide for how the state's economic landscape may evolve given the recent economic trends. The current projections cover the year 2017 to 2026 for approximately 130 industries and 800 occupations.

Star Jobs


Star Jobs
North Carolina Star Jobs is a new and simplified way to help you identify promising occupations. Star ratings are assigned based on wages, projected growth rate, and projected job openings, and each occupation has a rating of between one and five stars. Occupations with five stars are considered to have much better career prospects than occupations with fewer stars.
2019 Star Jobs
We have developed the 2019 Star Jobs based on the 2026 Occupational Projections.  The 526 occupations statewide were rated based on a slightly updated methodology.

You can also sort data by clicking on the triangle icon on the column header (such as Stars or Title header). Detailed occupational information are available by clicking the green plus sign (“+”) next to the occupational title.

Preparing A New Business Location


 


We get your site shovel, pad or move-in ready, so you can get to work.



 


No site or building is one-size-fits all in economic development. Every project is unique, and requires a site with unique assets. Building and site funds allow North Carolina to help upfit, expand or otherwise invest in sites to get them ready for action, saving companies time and money.



 





 
              Building Reuse Grants            



The Building Reuse Program, under the Rural Economic Development Division at Commerce, provides grants to local governments to help renovate older buildings into attractive business locations.  Funding is available from both state and federal sources, and eligible projects can include currently vacant buildings or buildings occupied by an existing North Carolina company wishing to expand in their current location.  Commerce can also help with the expansion or construction of health care entities that will lead to the creation of new, full-time jobs.
Eligiblity requirements differ by program, but in general - these grants go to units of local government located in either a Tier 1 or Tier 2 county, or a rural census tract in a Tier 3 county.  Review the current tier designations. 
In Tier 1 or Tier 2 counties, priority will be given to towns or communities with populations less than 5,000.



 






 





 
              Demolition Grants            



Demolition Grants support the demolition of a vacant building to encourage site rehabilitation and site availability for economic development purposes. Funding is available through the Rural Grants Program and the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s Small Cities Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. 



 






 





 
              Shell Buildings            



Loans for industrial shell buildings are available from the Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) based on the projected number of jobs to be created and the level of distress in the community.



 






 





 
              Agriculture Sites | Gas Products Fund            



The Expanded Gas Products Service to Agriculture Fund provides grants to allow the owner of a project that would facilitate new and expanded natural gas and propane gas service, or that would expand agricultural production or processing capabilities, to pay for excess infrastructure costs, or to pay for cost effective alternatives that would reduce excess infrastructure costs.

              Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA)            

 














Trade Adjustment Assistance provides re-employment assistance to workers who have been negatively impacted by foreign trade. Through job referrals, training, and income support, this program is designed to help workers find new jobs.
Benefits and Services
TAA certified workers may be eligible for the following benefits and services:
Skills assessments, career counseling, and labor market information
Up to 130 weeks of training
Income support
Job search allowance
Relocation allowance
ATAA (wage subsidy)
Details of the TAA benefits and services listed above are also available.
Program Eligibility
To qualify for benefits, affected workers must file a petition with the U.S. Department of Labor within a year of the layoff. The Labor department will initiate an investigation to determine if certain trade-related circumstances were met. These factors include the following:
An increase of imported articles or services
A shift in production to or an acquisition of services or articles from any foreign country by a company
An employer losing business from a customer with TAA-certified workers
An employer that is identified as trade-injured by the International Trade Commission
The Labor department must approve the petition in order for a group of affected workers to be eligible for TAA benefits and services. Workers must quality separately for each benefit, and they will be notified of their potential eligibility by the N.C. Division of Workforce Solutions.
How to Apply
Petitions can be filed online or by mail. The petition can be downloaded here and may be filed by one of the following parties:
Three or more workers in the same firm or subdivision
The worker’s employer
A union official or other duly authorized representative of such workers
State workforce agencies
For More Information
Find your nearest NCWorks Career Center. You can also call the Trade Adjustment Assistance Unit at 919-814-0373.

              Demolition | State Rural Grants            

 














The Demolition Grant Program provides grants to local governments to support the demolition of a vacant building to encourage site rehabilitation and site availability for economic development purposes.
Eligible applicants are units of local government located in either a Tier 1 or Tier 2 county, or a rural census tract in a Tier 3 county. You can find more about the state's tier designations elsewhere on our site.  In Tier 1 or Tier 2 counties, priority will be given to towns or communities with populations less than 5,000.
A rural census tract is an area having a population density of less than 500 people per square mile according to the most recent decennial federal census, per state statute N.C.G.S. 143B-472.127(a)(2). You can review a map of the rural census tract designations.
The demolition program application, forms and our submission deadlines are also available.

              Film Industry Grants            

 














North Carolina, a world-renowned film-friendly state, offers rebates up to 25% on qualified production expenses. Film makers also enjoy minimal permitting and access to experienced hands to assist the production of their film, television, or commercial project.
Film and Entertainment Grant Program
Through the North Carolina Film and Entertainment Grant, North Carolina offers a rebate of up to 25% on qualified expenses and purchases made by productions while filming in the state. To qualify, a television series must average a minimum in-state spend of $1 million per episode, while a feature-length film must spend at least $3 million, made-for-television movies must spend at least $1 million, and a commercial production must have a minimum spend of at least $250,000. Grant awards shall not exceed $12 million per season for a television series, $7 million for a feature-length film (including made-for-television movies), and $250,000 for commercials.
More information on the grant program can be found on the NC Film Office website.
To apply for the Film and Entertainment Grant, productions should:
Download and familiarize themselves with the program's enabling statute and recent changes (PDF)
Download and familiarize themselves with the program guidelines (PDF) - revised June 14, 2018
Complete the NC Film Office's Intent to Film Notification Form
Complete the formal Film and Entertainment Grant Application, which the NC Film Office will send to each applicant after reviewing your completed “Intent” form and verifying your production is eligible
The North Carolina Film and Entertainment Grant is funded at $31 million each fiscal year (July 1-June 30).  The funding is designated recurring and has no sunset date.  Any remaining/unused funds do roll over from fiscal year to fiscal year.
Support for Your Production in North Carolina
The N.C. Film Office helps expedite production schedules, serving as a liaison with public and private interests to secure locations and services for production. Working with regional film commissions, the state Film Office helps cut through the red tape on state, county and local levels. 
In addition to financial support funded by the state's Film and Entertainment Grant, the Film Office handles all aspects of production including assisting companies and productions with set up in North Carolina, successfully negotiating and problem solving issues that arise during the making of film, and leveraging the success of completed and distributed projects as an activation tool in promoting North Carolina film and tourism. 
North Carolina boasts a workforce of more than 4,000 film professionals and thousands of quality film locations. Film industry professionals can register and search for crew members or support services with the N.C. Film Directory, or locations with the N.C. Location Search. 
The Film Office is a unit of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. For more information on North Carolina’s ever-growing film industry, incentives and advantages of bringing your project to the state, and North Carolina's latest productions, visit the official site of the N.C. Film Office.

              Building Reuse | Federal CDBG Economic Development            

 














Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds for renovation and up-fitting of vacant industrial and commercial buildings for economic development purposes.  The building reuse program is designed to return vacant industrial/commercial buildings to economic use for new and/or expanding business and industry.  The ultimate goal of the Building Reuse program is to provide jobs for low and moderate-income persons (LMI).
The North Carolina Small Cities Community Development Block Program provides funds to local governments to develop viable communities, “by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income.”  The program reflects purposes of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended.  The Department of Commerce (DOC) has administrative responsibility for the CDBG program.  The Rural Economic Development Division (REDD) administers the economic development (ED) category for the Department of Commerce.  State rules related to the CDBG program are found in North Carolina Administrative Code 4 NCAC 19L and specific CDBG economic development rules are found at 4 NCAC 1K.
Eligible Applicants
In North Carolina, all counties except for Wake, Mecklenburg, and Cumberland and all municipalities except for 24 entitlement communities are eligible to apply for Small Cities CDBG funding.  The entitlement units, which receive CDBG program funds directly from HUD, include Asheville, Burlington, Cary, Chapel Hill, Charlotte, Concord, Durham, Fayetteville, Gastonia, Goldsboro, Greensboro, Greenville, Hickory, High Point, Jacksonville, Kannapolis, Lenoir, Morganton, New Bern, Raleigh, Rocky Mount, Salisbury, Wilmington and Winston-Salem.  The Town of Holly Springs in Wake County and the Town of Linden in Cumberland County continue to be eligible for Small Cities CDBG funds, because they opted to participate in the State’s program instead of their county’s program.  Projects proposed within the corporate limits of an entitlement area are ineligible for small cities CDBG funding.
All applicants must also meet basic threshold and performance requirements for any prior CDBG grants awarded by the Rural Economic Development Division.  
Program Contacts
The following Rural Economic Development Division staff member should be contacted for questions concerning the Building Reuse program:

            Iris Payne, Telephone: 919-814-4663; email:ipayne@nccommerce.com

GRANT LIMITS AND BASIC REQUIREMENTS

Building Reuse funds may be applied for at any time during the year, however the Rural Infrastructure Authority which meets six times a year must approve the application.  The Rural Economic Development Division is located in the EducationBuilding, 301 N. Wilmington Street in Raleigh, NC. The mailing address is: Rural Economic Development Division, 4346 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-4346 or by courier service at 301 N. Wilmington Street, Raleigh, NC 27601.
A local government applicant must propose a project in conjunction with a private for profit business that proposes to restore a vacant building to economic use resulting in the creation of permanent, full-time jobs by the project company.  A job is considered full-time if the employee works at least 1600 hours per year.  To be eligible, documentation must be provided showing the building has been vacant thirty (30) consecutive days or more prior to the date of the pre-application conference.  CDBG funds for this category are limited to a maximum of $750,000 per unit of government.  The grant amount is calculated based on $20,000 per job for eligible businesses (see chart below) and $12,000 per job for all other businesses.  To be eligible, a business must also meet all of the eligibility criteria specified in GS105-129.80.

              Job Training Assistance            

 














Employers can train employees through different programs that are designed to improve the skills of workers.
On-the-Job Training programs help employers train individuals for a position. The program reimburses companies for up to 50 percent of the employee’s wages during the time of the training.
Incumbent Worker Training grants reimburse companies for the cost of training their workers, helping to improve the skills of employees and the company’s competitiveness.
Apprenticeships prepare individuals for an industry through a combination of classroom instruction and On-the-Job Training.
Customized Training is offered through the state’s system of 58 community colleges.

              Building Reuse | State Rural Grants            

 














Develop older buildings in your community into assets to attract new or expanding businesses with the state's Building Reuse Program.  This program provides grants to local governments, using three categories of funding for:
The renovation of vacant buildings
The renovation or expansion of a building occupied by an existing North Carolina company wishing to expand in their current location
The renovation, expansion or construction of health care entities that will lead to the creation of new, full-time jobs.
Vacant Building Category
Grants are available to support the renovation of vacant buildings. The building must be vacant for at least three months prior to application deadlines.
Existing Building Category - Eligible Projects
Grants are available to support the renovation or expansion of buildings occupied by a company operating in the state of North Carolina for at least 12 months. Companies must also meet the weekly wage standard, provide at least 50% benefits to employees and be represented on the Priority Industry Table.
Rural Health Category - Eligible Projects
Grants are available to support the renovation, expansion or construction of health care entities. The health care entity must be licensed by the State of North Carolina. Eligible applicants are units of local government located in either a Tier 1 or Tier 2 county, or a rural census tract in a Tier 3 county.  More on the state's Tier system is available elswhere on our site.
In Tier 1 or Tier 2 counties, priority will be given to towns or communities with populations less than 5,000.
As prescribed in N.C.G.S. 143B-472.127(a)(2), a rural census tract is an area having a population density of less than 500 people per square mile according to the most recent decennial federal census.  A map of North Carolia's Rural Census Tracts located in our Tier 3 counties is available.
The program requires a cash match equal to the grant request amount. The local government must contribute at least 5% of the cash match. The cash match shall come from local resources and may not be derived from other State or federal grant funds.

              Competitive Incentives            

 



















 


Incentives that pay off for business and for North Carolina communities.



 


Two discretionary, performance-based incentive programs offer companies options to offset the cost of locating or expanding in North Carolina. Through the Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) and the One North Carolina Program (One NC), we tailor grants to best fit the needs of the community attracting jobs and the company making an investment. 



 





 
              Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG)            



The JDIG award is North Carolina's signature economic development incentive and can often be a decisive factor in a company's decision to expand or locate in North Carolina.
Job Development Investment Grants are considered in situations where the state is competing with other attractive business locations.
A sample of companies awarded JDIG grants include:
Credit Suisse, bringing 1,200 jobs to the Research Triangle region • announced May, 2017
Infosys, the Indian IT firm, with 2,000 jobs coming to RTP • announced July, 2017
Allstate Insurance, bringing 2,250 jobs to Mecklenburg County • announced August, 2017
EGGER Wood Products, the Austrian manufacturer, choosing Davidson County for a 770 job, $770M project • announced July, 2017
Triangle Tyre, the Chinese tire manufacturer, investing $580 million in Edgecombe County, in the eastern part of our state.  800 jobs are being created with that project • announced December, 2017
Publix, the grocery chain, creating 1,000 jobs in Greensboro • announced August, 2018
 


 








North Carolina offered a great site, overwhelming support and an overall climate that made this a perfect fit.

Toshiaki Fukunaga, Morinaga & Co. general manager of research and development



 
 


 








One North Carolina Fund
The North Carolina Department of Commerce administers OneNC grants on behalf of the Governor.  Awards can be deployed relatively quickly and help companies offset the costs associated with creating new jobs in the state.
OneNC grants also underscore the partnership and collaboration between the state and local jurisdictions that benefit companies that do business in North Carolina.  OneNC awards require that a local government provide an incentive to match the OneNC funding.  Local governments follow a formula for this required local match based on the tier designation of the county where the project is located.









Other Incentive Programs


 










Public Infrastructure Funds
Funding to improve or extend public infrastructure to better attract jobs to a community. 






 


 










Building or Site Funds
Funds demolition, reuse or expansion of existing buildings to upfit for new projects.  






 


 










Workforce Grants
Funding to offset the cost of on-the-job training and other workforce development programs.






 


 










Technology Funds
Companies can receive funding from the state or NC Biotech Center to support science and technology innovations.

              High-Risk Employees (Federal Bonding)            

 














Employers considering hiring “at risk” workers are encouraged to take advantage of a federal program designed to protect them against employee theft or dishonesty.
How It Works
Federal Bonding provides FREE individual fidelity bonds to employers when they hire “at risk” individuals, who traditionally have had difficulty finding meaningful employment. Employers receive $5,000 in coverage for the first six months of employment. The coverage protects the employer from acts of dishonesty such as theft, larceny or embezzlement.
Eligible individuals include the following:
Individuals with a history of arrest or conviction.
Individuals with a history of substance abuse.
Individuals with poor credit or who have declared bankruptcy.
Individuals with a dishonorable discharge from the military.
Individuals lacking sufficient work history.
Requirements & Limits:
There must be an Employer/Employee relationship.
The Employer must be deducting all required federal and state income taxes from pay.
The employee must be receiving a W2 at the end of the year (No 1099 or contract workers).
Self-employed individuals are NOT eligible for the Federal Bonding Program.
Bond must be established prior to the first day of work.
Steps to establish a bond:
The Employer contacts an NCWorks Career Center or the Federal Bonding Coordinator.
Staff complete the Federal Bonding Certification form.
Staff send the form to the Federal Bonding Coordinator.

              On-The-Job Training            

 















On-the-Job Training provides North Carolina a means to expand and enhance workforce service delivery to the State’s citizens. OJT is a viable pathway for unemployed workers seeking employment and for employers seeking workers. It offers the unique opportunity to offset initial training costs to fill skilled positions while building organizational productivity as the employee learns job requirements. An OJT arrangement can be the impetus for an employer to create a job opportunity.  
Through OJT, a wage reimbursement incentive may be provided to a business to help offset the cost of training a new employee with limited skills. Wage reimbursement ranges from 50 to 75 percent, depending upon the size of the business, with the higher percentage for businesses with up to 250 employees.
OJT contracts are limited to the time required for the employee to become proficient in his/her job, not to exceed six months. Prior to hire, an individualized training plan is developed with the employer that will allow the new employee to gain the required competencies.
For more information, contact a Workforce Development Board Business Services Representative in your area or DWS Business Services at 919-814-0321.

              Demolition | Federal (CDBG)            

 














Federal funds are made available annually through the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to the State of North Carolina for the Small Cities Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program.  These guidelines are provided to assist local governments in applying for funding under the CDBG Economic Development (ED) category for demolition projects that result in industrial or commercial sites.  The Department of Commerce (DOC) has administrative responsibility for the CDBG program in North Carolina.  The Rural Economic Development Division (REDD) administers the CDBG-ED funds. The Division is located at 301 North Wilmington Street, Raleigh. State rules related to the CDBG program are found in North Carolina Administrative Code 4 NCAC 19L and specific ED rules are found at 4 NCAC 1K.
Purpose
Under the authority of Title I of the U. S. Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (as amended), the CDBG demolition program in North Carolina is designed to demolish vacant dilapidated industrial buildings and properties under the elimination of slums and blight national objective. The demolition activity is expected to create a site at which it can reasonably be expected new jobs and private sector investment will locate. Since the demolition activity is qualified under the slums and blight national objective, new job creation with a private employer does not require a legally binding contract.  Jobs creation during the demolition phase of the grant should be collected for CDBG reporting purposes.
Eligible Applicants
In North Carolina, all counties except for Wake, Mecklenburg, and Cumberland and all municipalities except for 24 entitlement communities are eligible to apply for Small Cities CDBG funding. The entitlement units, which receive CDBG program funds directly from HUD, include Asheville, Burlington, Cary, Chapel Hill, Charlotte, Concord, Durham, Fayetteville, Gastonia, Goldsboro, Greensboro, Greenville, Hickory, High Point, Jacksonville, Kannapolis, Lenoir, Morganton, New Bern, Raleigh, Rocky Mount, Salisbury, Wilmington and Winston-Salem.  The Town of Holly Springs in Wake County and the Town of Linden in Cumberland County continue to be eligible for Small Cities CDBG funds as they opted to participate in the State’s program.
The local government applicant must also have the capacity to administer the proposed project with either its own staff or with the assistance of a consultant.  All applicants must also meet basic threshold and performance requirements for any prior CDBG grants. 
Program Contacts
Applicants are encouraged to contact the Rural Economic Development Division early in the development of a project. In many cases, the project company involved may find other financing programs administered within the REDD such as the Utility Account or the state rural development programs more beneficial.  Basic facts and project structural information are general to most economic development programs, and the Department of Commerce is interested in avoiding unnecessary duplication as projects are developed.
Contact
Questions relating to CDBG economic development projects should be directed to the following REDD staff member:

              Rural ReadySites            

 















The North Carolina Department of Commerce's new Rural ReadySites grant program helps local communities prepare potential industrial sites for development.
	Many communities have promising sites in their areas that could offer an attractive location for a business, if certain public infrastructure improvements were undertaken to make the site more competitive and prepared for industrial development.
	The Department's Rural ReadySites program, operating under the jurisdiction of the Rural Infrastructure Authority, aims to invest $12 million in local North Carolina communities in 2018. To participate, a project must meet the following criteria:
The applicant must be a governmental entity in a Tier 1 or 2 county.
The site must be publicly owned or controlled.
The site must be a minimum of 50 contiguous acres.
There must be evidence of appropriate and proportionate local financial support for site development, which may include but not be limited to site acquisition, development costs and/or infrastructure improvements.
There must be evidence of recent private sector interest in developing an industrial project on the site.
There must be evidence of a well thought-out strategy to identify and market the site to appropriate private sector businesses.
Funds will only be used to construct public infrastructure, with priority given to water, sewer and industrial access improvements.
Additional consideration will be given to sites located in counties with the greatest economic distress ranking
Communities interested in applying for the Rural ReadySites program should download the pre-application form available here.
	Download the Rural ReadySites program criteria here.
For more information about the Rural ReadySites program, contact:
	Mark Poole
	Phone: 919 814-4616

              Work Opportunity Tax Credit            

 















The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a federal tax credit available to employers who hire individuals from eligible target groups who are qualified for positions but face significant barriers to employment.
In North Carolina, the Commerce Department’s Division of Workforce Solutions administers WOTC and determines eligibility for the target groups.
The tax credit employers can claim depends upon the target group of the individual hired, the wages paid to that individual in the first year of employment, and the number of hours that individual worked. A business can receive from $1,200 to $9,600 for each eligible employee.
Find more information below:










How to Apply for WOTC Certification


How to Apply for WOTC Certification
Step 1: Complete the IRS Form 8850 “Pre-Screening Notification and Certification Request” Instructions Form 8850
Step 2: Complete the ETA Form 9061 “Individual Characteristics Form.”
NC WOTC will also accept ETA Form 9062, Conditional Certification from NC DHHS Vocational Rehabilitation agencies.  Applications with ETA Form 9062 must be mailed with IRS Form 8850 to
N.C. Department of Commerce
	Division of Workforce Solutions
Attn: WOTC
4316 Mail Service Center
	Raleigh, NC 27699-4316
Step 3: Register as a user at www.ncworkswotc.com. Electronically submit the request to the Division of Workforce Solutions within 28 days of the new employee start date and mail available documentation supporting eligibility of the requested target group. Hard copies of Form 8850 and ETA Form 9061 are retained by employers for their records.
Step 4: Receive electronic determination of certification for eligibility of the WOTC target groups, denial with explanation or request for additional information via the www.ncworkswotc.com user account.  



Filing to Receive WOTC


Filing to Receive WOTC
After receiving a certification, employers may file for the tax credit with the IRS. Generally, an employer elects to take the credit by filing IRS Form 3800 and IRS Form 5884. However, a tax-exempt organization that hires an employee in the WOTC veteran target group should use IRS Form 5884-C. Employers also must meet requirements for the Minimum Employment Period, which is the number of hours required to be worked by the employee – at least 120 hours in the first year of employment – before they can file and qualify for the tax credit.

              County Distress Rankings (Tiers)            

 



















The North Carolina Department of Commerce annually ranks the state’s 100 counties based on economic well-being and assigns each a Tier designation. This Tier system is incorporated into various state programs to encourage economic activity in the less prosperous areas of the state.
The 40 most distressed counties are designated as Tier 1, the next 40 as Tier 2 and the 20 least distressed as Tier 3.
Review the 2019 County Tier Designations Memo (published November 30, 2018)
County Tiers are calculated using four factors:
Average unemployment rate
Median household income
Percentage growth in population
Adjusted property tax base per capita
Beginning with the 2019 rankings,  only these four factors determine final Tier rank.  In previous years, additional 'adjustment factors' were also considered in the calculations.  In 2018, the North Carolina General Assembly eliminated these adjustment factors from the Tier ranking methodology (S.L. 2018-5, Section 15.2.a).

Loans for industrial shell buildings are available from the Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) based on the projected number of jobs to be created and the level of distress in the community. These loans will be at a 2% interest rate with a maximum term of 5 years. Principle payments are deferred for the first two years of the loan. A dollar for dollar match is required by the local government applicant for an industrial shell building.

              For Young Adults Seeking Jobs in North Carolina            

 















North Carolina’s youth and young adults are a crucial part of the state’s workforce, and it’s important that they be given the tools they need to advance their education and careers. Youth services provide young adults people with opportunities to prepare for and advance their education and careers.
How It Works
Traditional employment and young adult development programs teach participants how to maintain positive relationships with responsible adults and peers, explore opportunities for community service, and develop leadership skills. As part of the program, each young person will assess their skills and participate in a program that’s designed to address their individual needs.
Young adult services may include the following opportunities:
Tutoring and study skills training
Alternative secondary school
Summer employment opportunities
Paid and unpaid work experiences, including internships and job shadowing
Occupational skill training
Leadership development
Supportive services
Adult mentoring
Follow-up services
Comprehensive guidance and counseling
Financial literacy education
Entrepreneurial skills training
Labor market and employment information
Activities to help prepare for training and education
How to Qualify
Participants must be in one of two categories for young people to be eligible to receive services: in-school or out-of-school.  
In-school youth must be attending school, be between 14-21 years old, low-income and have one or more of the following characteristics:

Basic skills deficient


An English learner


Homeless/runaway/out-of-home placement/foster care/aged out of foster care


An offender


Pregnant or parenting


An individual with a disability


Require additional assistance to complete an educational program or to secure or hold employment.

Out-of-school youth must not be attending any school, be between 16-24 years old and have one or more of the following characteristics:

A school dropout


Within age of compulsory school attendance, but has not attended school for at least the most recent complete school year calendar quarter


Recipient of a secondary school diploma or equivalent who is low-income and basic skills deficient or an English language learner


Subject to the juvenile or adult justice system


Homeless/runaway/foster care/aged out of foster care/out-of-home placement


Pregnant or parenting


An individual with a disability


A low-income individual who requires additional assistance to enter or complete an educational program or to secure or hold employment

The state’s Workforce Development Boards work with schools, businesses, community organizations, and other local partners to provide support and funding for local youth programs.
NCWorks Online
The state’s official job-search portal, NCWorks Online allows youth to search for jobs, find local training opportunities, and learn about industries and occupations to prepare for their careers. The system also provides information on programs and opportunities for youth in their communities.
How to Apply
Contact your local Workforce Development Board for information on local youth services.
Youth can use NCWorks Online to search for jobs and training opportunities in their areas. Registration is free.

              Apprentice Programs            

 














Employers who want to gain highly skilled workers should consider working with Apprenticeships.
Apprenticeships offer several advantages to businesses. By training an apprentice in a way that most effectively meets your needs, employers can strengthen their companies by investing in an apprentice who will use his or her skills to make them stronger.
North Carolina's Apprenticeship program is now managed by the North Carolina Community College System.  To learn more, visit the program's website at ApprenticeshipNC.

The NC Department of Commerce Reentry Initiative provides resources and assistance to job seekers with criminal records to help them overcome the barriers toward employment created by a criminal record.
How It Works
Each NCWorks Career Center provides services to individuals with criminal records. Career center staff ensure those job seekers have the necessary resources to conduct an effective job search.
In addition to the services provided to all job seekers, individuals with a criminal record have access to the following:
Help with writing resumes and a “letter of explanation” detailing their criminal record and/or incarceration and indicating rehabilitative efforts.
Knowledge about employers' policies concerning hiring individuals with a criminal record.
Workshops specific to addressing concerns of individuals with criminal records.
Referrals to community organizations that assist individuals with criminal records.
Information on Federal Bonding and the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.
Career centers also work with federal, state, and local providers of reentry services, including community- and faith-based organizations, and vocational rehabilitation centers.
In addition to the economic value of obtaining employment, an individual who finds a job is less likely to be re-arrested or return to prison than those who do not obtain employment.
Individuals who need additional assistance may be referred to their Regional Reentry Specialist after being registered in NCWorks.
NCWorks Online
Each career center has computer terminals for job seekers to access the Internet and use NCWorks Online to find jobs.
In addition to letting users search for jobs, NCWorks Online can show users how their current skill sets match the skills required by employers for a particular position. Career center staff are also available to help job seekers use the website.
How to Get Started
Job seekers with criminal records can contact their local NCWorks Career Center for these employment services.
For help with general questions or concerns, email the Program Coordinator at DWS_Re-Entry@nccommerce.com.

State Trade Expansion Program (STEP)
The N.C. Passport to Export program was created to help small businesses grow globally. By growing globally, small businesses thrive locally.
The North Carolina Passport to Export Grant program is designed to increase:

              For Veterans Seeking Jobs in North Carolina            

 















Our team at the Division of Workforce Solutions provides experienced help to veterans, transitioning service members, and eligible spouses seeking a job.  North Carolina, home to nearly 800,000 veterans and several of the nation's most important defense installations, understands the needs and challenges of military life.

more than 250 small businesses bring to market biotechnology, nanotechnology, medical technologies, computer software, military/defense technologies, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and other high-tech applications.
more than 77 percent of the small businesses to remain in operation.
the small businesses to attract more than $515 million in external investment, including more than $122 million in follow-on federal funds.
60 percent of NC matching grant winners to win Phase II federal grant awards, each with a considerably larger average value of $1 million (nationally, 54 percent of Phase I award winners graduate to Phase II awards).
the small businesses to produce more than $125 million in total sales resulting directly from the technology developed with Program funding.
significant technology/business-development partnerships among NC universities & businesses.

              Building Reuse            

 














Suitable buildings for business use are a fundamental building block for economic development, and many older buildings in your community can still offer an attractive location for a growing company.  However, the costs for renovating or upfitting these buildings can be prohibitive.
That's where our Building Reuse Program comes into play.  Our rural development specialists can guide and assist you in finding grants that can bring old buildings back to useful life.
Read more about our state and federal building reuse solutions or contact our program managers for additional information.

              Workforce Assistance - GoldenLEAF            

 














The Golden LEAF Foundation, a North Carolina grant-making organization, can provide support to help a company train and develop a skilled workforce.  Golden LEAF supports projects that help close the skills gap and increase the pool of highly-qualified people in a North Carolina community, both now and in the future. The foundation funds projects that demonstrate a market demand for skilled workers and aim at developing skill sets required by businesses looking to locate or expand in a North Carolina rural community.
The Foundation's Economic Catalyst grant program includes a category that supports workforce development, with funding to help with the delivery of training programs offered by eligible entities, typically the local community college.
Golden LEAF funds are usually used for acquisition of training equipment or construction/renovation of space needed to provide the training.
Training must be available to the public and be for transferable skills.
Golden LEAF funds may be used in conjunction with, but not to displace training funds available through other sources such as the NC Community College System.
When Golden LEAF funds are used for costs associated with job training, Golden LEAF will typically require evidence of an inducement agreement demonstrating that the company is obligated to meet the job creation projections and wage goals, and providing appropriate consequences should the company fail to satisfy its obligations; however, Golden LEAF usually does not require a clawback specifically for the Golden LEAF grant funds.
Golden LEAF's website offers more information about the workforce grants available from the foundation.

              Economic Development Reports            

 














Find information to support your economic development project in the State of North Carolina with these reports and resources:










Area Demographic Profiles


Area Demographic Profiles
Area Demographic Profiles provide a glimpse into the business environment and quality of life across a variety of North Carolina geographies. Topics include demographics, education, housing, unemployment, and wages by industry.  These reports are also sometimes referred to as County Profiles.


Community Investment Report


Community Investment Report







The 2017 Community Investment Report (CIR) is a comprehensive collection of economic development announcements for capital investment, infrastructure development, and job creation in North Carolina. This information is collected by the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina (EDPNC) and reported quarterly. CIR relies on partners across the state to report projects, and does not necessarily capture every announced job or dollar invested in North Carolina. EDPNC submits CIR data to third party entities that determine North Carolina’s rankings on nationally recognized lists such as Site Selection's Top State Business Climates.
For members of the economic development community, business owners, and news organizations, submit CIR information here.
For inquiries regarding this information, please call (919) 447-7773 or send an email to justin.mccoy@edpnc.com.









International Trade Report


International Trade Report
The 2017 North Carolina International Trade Report analyzes exports of goods (both manufactured and raw materials) from North Carolina, the state's support of those exports, and trends over time. In addition, the report includes North Carolina's top export markets and top export commodities.
For older versions of the International Trade Report, visit the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina's Publications page.


Tourism Data


Tourism Data
Research provides critical information that shapes the strategic direction of Visit North Carolina, the public-private organization that markets North Carolina as a visitor destination, under contract with the N.C. Department of Commerce.
The state’s communications, tourism advocacy and customer service efforts are based on ongoing analysis of research. The Visit North Carolina research team works closely with third-party research organizations and government agencies to monitor North Carolina domestic and international visitation.
Visitor data and other published research help local communities and tourism-industry partners plan, implement, and evaluate processes and programs. Calculating the economic impact of travel and tourism helps policy makers make strategic decisions about the long-term health of tourism, assess capital investment and gauge the amount of government support.


Economic Impact of the Military in NC


Economic Impact of the Military in NC

The Economic Impact of the Military on North Carolina (2015) analyzes the military's impact on our state in a broad sense. The first section of the report begins with an overview of the major military facilities in North Carolina, followed by a discussion of military contracting performed in the state, active military personnel levels, projected separations from the military, estimates of the veteran population, and pensions distributed within the state. The second section of the report details the methodology used to measure the economic impact of the U.S. military on North Carolina’s economy in 2015. The third section discusses the results from the economic impact model including sectors and industries supported by the military, as well as estimates for the military’s contribution to personal income and gross state product.
 


Food Manufacturing in NC


Food Manufacturing in NC
The North Carolina Food Manufacturing Task Force Final Report summarizes the work of the North Carolina Food Manufacturing Task Force, established April 2015 and charged with the implementation of four broad tasks:
Develop a strategic business plan to leverage existing activities in food processing and manufacturing;
Establish a statewide food processing and manufacturing organization, directory and database;
Create a plan to develop a proactive industrial recruitment campaign for new business development;
Plan to foster the growth of food manufacturing entrepreneurial endeavors, enhance development of innovative food products and processes, and provide sector-specific regulatory training and outreach.
 

EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program | N.C. Targeted Employment Areas (TEA)


EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program | N.C. Targeted Employment Areas (TEA)
Investors interested in participating in the federal government's EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program will find North Carolina's Targeted Employment Areas (TEA) and other supporting documentation here:
EB-5/Targeted Employment Area Documents
The N.C. Department of Commerce and its Division of Employment Security (formerly the Employment Security Commission of North Carolina or ESC) have developed a statewide system for identifying TEA to meet the criteria of the EB-5 visa program.
Effective October 15, 2018, requests to certify TEAs consisting of multiple census tracts will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. They must be contiguous, include all tracts bordering the tract in which the project is located, and contain no more than ten census tracts. If a proposed TEA contains more than ten census tracts or does not include all bordering tracts, please provide supporting documentation that the proposed TEA reflects the geographic area in which the enterprise is principally doing business and an explanation of how the investment will benefit all the census tracts included.
Visit the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website for a list of current EB-5 (Immigrant Investor) Regional Centers.
Background information
Created by the U.S. Congress in 1990, the fifth employment-based visa (EB-5) is available to immigrants seeking to enter the United States in order to invest in a new commercial enterprise that will benefit the nation's economy and create at least 10 full-time jobs. There are two ways to invest within the EB-5 category, creating a new commercial enterprise or investing in a troubled business. To qualify, one must invest or be in the process of investing at least $1,000,000. If the investment is in a designated Targeted Employment Area (TEA), the minimum investment requirement is $500,000.

              Labor Market Publications            

 














The North Carolina Department of Commerce and our Labor & Economic Analysis Division produce a number of useful publications focused on labor markets in the state and nation.










NC Today


NC Today
NC Today is a monthly review of labor market conditions in North Carolina with comparative data from the United States as a whole, and from selected Southern states on various aspects of the economy.


Labor Market Conditions


Labor Market Conditions
State Labor Market Conditions provides a monthly overview of the workforce across North Carolina. It is prepared as an accompaniment for the release of monthly state labor force statistics. State labor force, employment, and unemployment data are presented in narrative and graphic format comparing current month data to the previous month and year. Unemployment insurance activities are also reported.
County Labor Market Conditions provide an expanded overview of the workforce in North Carolina's 100 counties. It is prepared as an accompaniment for the release of monthly county labor force statistics. County labor force, employment, and unemployment data are presented in narrative and graphic format comparing current month data to the previous month and year. Unemployment insurance activities are also reported.


Labor Market Overviews by Workforce Board


Labor Market Overviews by Workforce Board
The Labor Market Overviews by Workforce Board are fact sheets comprised of economic and labor market data specific to each of the 23 WDB areas. Most of the included data has been selected by the WDBs, and includes unemployment rates, unemployment insurance claims, new corporations, and civilian labor force, in addition to other data.

Area Demographic Profiles


Area Demographic Profiles
Area Demographic Profiles provide a glimpse into the business environment and quality of life across a variety of North Carolina geographies. Topics include demographics, education, housing, unemployment, and wages by industry. These reports are also sometimes referred to as County Profiles.


Prosperity Zone Data Books


Prosperity Zone Data Books
These data books serve as an introduction to the economies of North Carolina's eight Prosperity Zones, providing a broad overview of the labor market and demographic trends occurring in each. The Prosperity Zones contain between 10 and 17 counties and vary in population from about half a million to more than 2 million. Two of the zones — Southwest and North Central — are heavily influenced by the presence of the state’s two largest cities, Charlotte and Raleigh. Other zones contain a mixture of metropolitan (greater than 50,000 residents), micropolitan (10,000 to 50,000 residents), and rural areas. Although each zone is presented as a single unit in the data that follows, it is important to remember there is a great deal of variation within each zone.

Employer Needs Survey


Employer Needs Survey
The 2018 Employer Needs Survey, carried out by the Labor and Economic Analysis Division (LEAD) of the North Carolina Department of Commerce and the NCWorks Commission, is a survey of over 1,900 establishments of all sizes from across the state. The goal of the survey was to identify the needs of employers across the state, with a particular emphasis on hiring difficulties and recruitment and retention practices. In addition to an overall sample of all industries, we surveyed four industry-specific samples: Manufacturing, Construction, Health Care & Social Assistance (Health Care), and a set of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics-related industries (STEM).


North Carolina Annual Economic Report


North Carolina Annual Economic Report
The 2016 North Carolina Annual Economic Report provides a snapshot of North Carolina’s most recent annual labor market data, along with some historical context. This report will help support workforce planning and the process of making policy decisions for workforce development, education, economic development and business engagement.


Release Dates for Unemployment Rates


Release Dates for Unemployment Rates
Review the publication schedule for North Carolina's 2019 LAUS and CES data.  Release dates for US, statewide, and local area employment and unemployment statistics are included.

              Pipeline Development - Maximize Carolina            

 















Note: the Maximize Carolina program is no longer accepting grant applications. 
 
Maximize Carolina Sector grants help finance collaborative projects to address skills gaps in robust and emerging industry sectors, including information technology, energy, advanced manufacturing, environmental sustainability, aerospace, defense, analytics, industrial maintenance, healthcare, and hospitality/tourism.
These grants can be used to address challenges such as applicants lacking specific skills, lack of sector brand awareness, work-based learning opportunities for workers or students, and various other applicant pipeline challenges.
There are two grant categories:
Projects up to $50,000 for partnerships with at least two employers
Projects between $50,000-75,000 for partnerships with three or more employers
Matching Your Investment
Your partnership will raise a portion of the total project amount and the state will cover the remaining amount through the grant.
This match amount depends on the county tier levels of the business partners’ location. The Maximize Carolina Sector grant will provide 85% of the project amount in Tier 1 and 2 counties and 65% of the project amount in Tier 3 counties.
After the partnership raises its portion, then the local workforce development board will administer the grant funds.
For More Information
If you have questions, contact Marie Griffin at marie.griffin@nccommerce.com.

              File a WARN Notice            

 














As an employer, if your company plans to close a facility or conduct a mass personnel layoff, you may be required to file a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification—commonly called a WARN notice — with the state.
How Filing a WARN Notice Works
A federal law, the WARN Act, governs the process for filing a notice.  The act seeks to protect workers, their families, and their communities by requiring employers to provide 60 days’ advance notice of certain plant closings and mass layoffs. Businesses that employ at least 100 workers, excluding part-time workers, are required to file a WARN notice if they are preparing to take one of the following actions:
Close a plant that affects at least 50 employees during any 30-day period. (This does not include workers who have worked less than six months during the last year or employees who work less than an average of 20 hours a week.)
Conduct a mass layoff of at least 500 employees, or a layoff impacting between 50-499 employees when that number represents at least one-third of the employer’s workforce.
You must file your WARN notice with the following:
All affected workers or their representatives (e.g., a labor union)
The North Carolina Division of Workforce Solutions, a unit of the N.C. Department of Commerce
The chief elected official of the unit of local government where the site is located
After filing the WARN notice, our workforce Rapid Response team will contact you in 48 hours or less, to assist your workers and your Human Resources staff.
This sample WARN notice provides an example to guide you.
For More Information About Filing a WARN Notice
Write or call:
N.C. Department of Commerce
	Division of Workforce Solutions
	ATTN: Rapid Response Team
	4316 Mail Service Center
	Raleigh, N.C. 27699-4316
	Phone: (919) 814-0400 or (800) 562-6333
	Fax: (919) 662-4770
See also: WARN Summary Reports, which are published reports that lists the companies that have filed WARN notices with the Department.

Unemployment and the Great Recession in North Carolina: This report examines unemployed workers and unemployment insurance (UI) recipients in North Carolina during the Great Recession of 2007-2009 and its aftermath.  We use data from the federal government’s Current Population Survey and North Carolina’s Common Follow-up System to learn more about these individuals, including their characteristics and their employment outcomes. Our objective is to help workforce planners and policymakers understand the impact of the last recession so that they can develop strategies for alleviating unemployment during the next recession.

              Disaster Recovery            

 














In the span of about two years, North Carolina has been hit by two 500-year storms, Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018.
For these disasters and others, both state and federal funding fuel the recovery programs that help North Carolina communities rebuild in a smart, comprehensive way.  Learn more about the different sources of help in the sections below.










Recovery-State/Rural Grants


Recovery-State/Rural Grants
The N.C. General Assembly has provided funds to the Golden LEAF Foundation and the N.C. Department of Commerce’s Rural Economic Development Division to provide grants to local governments to help repair, replace or construct new infrastructure due to Hurricane Matthew and Hurricane Florence damage.  Eligible infrastructure recovery projects include water, sewer, storm drainage systems and items like sidewalks.
For more information on state-funded disaster recovery programs, contact:
Melody Adams, Director, Rural Grant Programs 
	Rural Economic Development Division 
	NC Department of Commerce 
	919-814-4661 (Office)melody.adams@nccommerce.com


Recovery-Federal/CDBG-DR


Recovery-Federal/CDBG-DR
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides flexible disaster recovery grants to help cities, counties, and states recover from Presidentially declared disasters, especially in low-income areas and subject to the availability of supplemental funds.   Specialists from N.C. Commerce's rural economic development team help administer these federal funds during times when this money is available.
The federal funding most often arrives as additional Congressional appropriations to the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, as Disaster Recovery grants to rebuild affected areas and provide crucial seed money to start the recovery process.
Since CDBG Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) assistance may fund a broad range of recovery activities, HUD can help communities and neighborhoods that otherwise might not recover due to limited resources.
Detailed information on the federal CDBG-DR program is available.


Disaster Dislocated Worker Grants


Disaster Dislocated Worker Grants
The U.S. Department of Labor awarded an $18.5 million Disaster Dislocated Worker Grant to help with Hurricane Florence response in late September 2018.  The North Carolina Department of Commerce’s Division of Workforce Solutions requested and administers this grant.
The counties eligible for this type of assistance by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are: Alleghany, Anson, Ashe, Beaufort, Bladen, Brunswick, Cabarrus, Carteret, Chatham, Columbus, Craven, Cumberland, Dare, Duplin, Granville, Greene, Harnett, Hoke, Hyde, Johnston, Lee, Lenoir, Jones, Montgomery, Moore, New Hanover, Onslow, Pamlico, Pender, Person, Pitt, Randolph, Richmond, Robeson, Sampson, Scotland, Stanly, Union, Wayne, Wilson and Yancey.
Through the federal grant, residents of eligible counties will work in jobs that support either clean-up and recovery from the storm’s devastation or humanitarian assistance to residents of affected areas. Supported by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), Dislocated Worker Grants fund temporary jobs in response to large, unexpected events that cause significant job losses.
Nonprofits and government agencies will employ participants for up to 12 months. Worksites must generally be on public property or land owned by not-for-profit agencies.
Workers may be eligible for jobs under the grant if they’ve been temporarily or permanently laid off as a consequence of the hurricane, or if they meet certain other criteria.
To apply for the Hurricane Florence temporary employment program, residents should visit their local NCWorks Career Center, which can be found by visiting www.ncworks.gov.

              North Carolina Certified Sites            

 














A North Carolina Certified Site reduces the risks associated with development.
Certification provides you with detailed information about a site and its features:
Price and availability
Utilities at the site
Access points for the site
Environmental concerns and potential development costs
Certified sites are periodically reviewed and re-certified, in order to ensure the data is accurate and reliable. 
Since 2001, North Carolina has offered an official Certified Sites program to provide a statewide inventory of industrial sites that have undergone a rigorous prequalification process to ensure they are “shovel ready” for immediate development.
North Carolina's Certified Sites are highlighted in the state's online database of available buildings and sites (select 'Advanced Search,' then choose 'NC Certified Site').
Communities wishing to submit a site for certification must undergo a stringent review process.
For more information about the Certified Sites Program, contact:
Austin Rouse
	Certified Sites Program Coordinator
	(919) 447-7793austin.rouse@edpnc.com

              One North Carolina Fund            

 














The One North Carolina Fund (OneNC) is a discretionary cash-grant program that allows the Governor to respond quickly to competitive job-creation projects.
The North Carolina Department of Commerce administers OneNC on behalf of the Governor. Awards are based on:
The number of jobs created
The level of investment
The location of the project
The economic impact of the project
The importance of the project to the state and region.
The OneNC program utilizes North Carolina's economic development tier system in its operations.  This tier system is incorporated into OneNC to encourage economic activity in the less prosperous areas of the state.  The North Carolina Department of Commerce annually ranks the state’s 100 counties based on economic well-being and assigns each a tier designation.  More details on how the economic development tier system operates is available.










Local Match Information


Local Match Information
One North Carolina awards are allocated to local governments as part of a negotiated challenge grant.
By statute, OneNC requires that a local government provide an incentive to match the OneNC funding. The required local match depends on the tier designation of the county.
In a Tier 1 county, the local government must provide no less than one dollar for every three dollars provided by One NC.
In a Tier 2 county, the local government must provide no less than one dollar for every two dollars provided by One NC.
In a Tier 3 county, the local government must provide no less than one dollar for every one dollar provided by One NC.
 

Eligibility Guidance


Eligibility Guidance
Eligible Use
Funds awarded from the One North Carolina Fund to a company must be used for:
Installation or purchase of equipment
Structural repairs, improvements or renovations of existing buildings
Construction of or improvements to water, sewer, gas or electric utility distribution lines or associated equipment for existing buildings
Construction of or improvements to water, sewer, gas or electric utility distribution lines or associated equipment for new or proposed buildings to be used for manufacturing and industrial operations
Basic Requirements for Eligibility
In order for a project to be considered for OneNC, the following criteria must be met:
The project must be competitive with locations outside North Carolina and remain competitive until the grant is formally awarded.
The project must meet the county average wage requirement.
The local government must match the grant via cash, fee waivers, in-kind services, infrastructure improvement or donations of land, buildings or other assets.
The company must provide health insurance and pay at least 50% of the premiums for participating employees.
The company must meet statutory occupational safety and environmental compliance requirements.
Applications are accepted on an ongoing basis and subject to availability of funds. The North Carolina Department of Commerce reviews applications and makes recommendations for funding to the Governor.
OneNC funding is dispersed in 25% increments as the company creates new jobs. For instance, if a company commits to creating 100 jobs over three years, as soon as the company has created the first 25 jobs, it is eligible to receive 25% of the award. North Carolina statute requires that the company maintain at least 90% of the new jobs in operation at the project location, or at another approved site in North Carolina, for a period of up to two years after the grant end date.

              Disaster Recovery | Federal CDBG-DR            

 














Federal funds from the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program (CDBG-DR) can help your comminity rebuild impacted areas, providing crucial seed money to start the recovery process.  CDBG-DR assistance, funded through U.S. Housing and Urban Development (HUD), may fund a broad range of recovery activities, helping communities and neighborhoods that otherwise might not recover due to limited resources.
Recovery
HUD appropriated $236,529,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds to the state of North Carolina for recovery from Hurricane Matthew.  The funds were provided in two separate appropriations:
$198,533,000 under Public Law 114-254
$37,976,000 under Public Law 115-31

Pollution Abatement Equipment & Recycling





Pollution Abatement Equipment 
Sales and Use Tax Exemption
Pollution  abatement equipment for manufacturing is exempt from sales and use tax. In addition, chemicals purchased by manufacturers to be used in air or stream pollution abatement equipment or processes are exempt from sales and use tax.
Pollution abatement equipment means any equipment, including parts and accessories, used to eliminate, prevent or reduce air and water pollutants emitted resulting from the manufacturing process. This category also includes equipment used for the purpose of treating, pretreating or modifying any potential solid, liquid or gaseous pollutants that might be harmful, detrimental or offensive to human, animal or plant life or to property. Neither buildings housing such control and abatement equipment, nor equipment used within a building’s interior primarily for health, comfort or safety purposes is eligible for this exemption.
Property Tax Exemption
North Carolina does not levy property tax on real and personal property that is used exclusively for air cleaning, waste disposal or to abate, reduce or prevent air and/or water pollution. To claim an exclusion on property tax liability, a taxpayer must apply to the county for exclusion during the annual listing period and apply to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality for exclusion certification.
Recycling 
The North Carolina Recycling Property Tax Exemption excludes equipment and facilities used exclusively for recycling and resource recovery from property tax liability. For more details and application information, please visit the Solid Waste Section of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality website.
Recycling Business Assistance Center, Recycling Business Development Grants
The Recycling Business Assistance Center (RBAC) is a partnership between the state Departments of Environmental Quality and Commerce. RBAC offers a variety of financial tools and incentives for recycling businesses, including tax credits, grants, loans and incentive programs.
In an effort to divert materials from the waste stream while supporting company growth, expansion and job creation in North Carolina, RBAC offers Recycling Business Development grants to eligible organizations. Funds are typically used for sustainable investments in equipment and buildings necessary to increase the capacity of a recycling company. Funding is made available through an annual request for proposal process that begins in the fall. Applicants may request a maximum of $40,000 and must provide at least a 50% cash match. For more information, visit the Grants section of the RBAC website.



 



Historic Preservation Tax Credit


Historic Preservation Tax Credit





If you own or lease a “certified historic structure,” as designated by either North Carolina's Historic Preservation Office or the U.S. Department of the Interior’s National Park Service, your structure is eligible for historic preservation tax credits.
Credits are available for the rehabilitation of:
Income-producing historic properties
Owner-occupied historic residences.
Historic Preservation Tax Credit Levels
A 15% state tax credit for rehabilitation of income-producing certified historic structures is awarded to rehabilitations that qualify for the federal tax credit and spend up to $10 million.
A 10% state tax credit for rehabilitation of income-producing certified historic structures is awarded to rehabilitations that qualify for the federal tax credit and are for expenses from $10 million to $20 million.
There is also a 5% bonus if the development is within a Tier 1 or Tier 2 county or is located in an eligible targeted investment site. This bonus may be applied for expenses up to $20 million.
The Historic Preservation Tax Credits program uses the state's economic development Tier System to encourage economic activity in the less prosperous areas of the state.   For more information about county tier designations, visit our County Development Tier Designations page.



 



Foreign Trade Zones (FTZ)


Foreign Trade Zones (FTZ)





Foreign Trade Zones
Foreign trade zones (FTZ), sometimes known as free trade zones, are geographically designated and secured areas that for legal purposes are considered outside of U.S. Customs territory. FTZs offer several economic advantages for companies involved in international trade.
North Carolina has four general-purpose FTZs and eighteen active subzones approved for use by individual companies. In addition, three of the zones have successfully transitioned to the Alternative Site Framework (ASF), which greatly simplifies service to users. An ASF has a large, preapproved service area in which the organization in charge of the FTZ, the grantee, can propose new sites. Within this broad service area, which incorporates several counties, the grantee can work with interested companies to establish sites intended for either an individual company’s use or the use of several companies.
Foreign or domestic merchandise may enter an FTZ without a formal customs entry document or payment of customs duties or government excise taxes. If the final product is exported from the United States, no customs duty is levied. If the final product is imported into the U.S., duty and excise taxes are due at the time of transfer from the FTZ and formal entry is made into the United States. Duty is paid on the product itself or its imported parts, whichever is lower.
Generally, merchandise is exempt from payment of duty even if it is:
Manipulated;
Used in a manufacturing process;
Inspected;
Combined with other domestic or foreign materials;
Displayed for sale, or
Re-exported.
Spoiled or damaged goods or waste materials may be destroyed, discarded or re-exported duty-free.
State and local governments generally do not impose sales and use taxes on items in an FTZ. For this reason, a company operating in such a zone can realize savings on such taxes as well as on interest, labor and shipping costs.
New capital investment by companies that might otherwise have located in foreign countries is another important advantage. This new investment activity spurs development of support industries.
The foreign trade zones in North Carolina are:
Zone #214 – This zone includes the Port of Wilmington, Port of Morehead City and the NC Global TransPark. Zone #214 is administered by the North Carolina Department of Transportation.
Zone #93 – The Greater Research Triangle Zone is based in Durham. Zone #93 is administered by the Triangle J Council of Governments.
Zone #230 – The Piedmont Triad Zone is  based in Greensboro. Zone #230 is administered by the Piedmont Triad Partnership.
Zone #57 – The Greater Charlotte Zone is based in Charlotte. Zone # 57 is administered by the Charlotte Regional Partnership.
Zone #20 – The Northeast NC Zone is based in Norfolk, Virginia. Zone #20 is administered by the Virginia Port Authority.

Guidebook on Local Planning for Healthy Communities


Guidebook on Local Planning for Healthy Communities
Consistent with its mission, the NC Department of Commerce sponsored preparation of a guidebook on integrating healthy planning principles into local comprehensive plans. The document has statewide applicability and provides technical assistance to municipalities and counties in solving local planning problems. Its focus is on multiple dimensions of healthy community planning, but it goes beyond that basic task to provide a resource guide for towns, cities, and counties in preparing a variety of local plans in addition to comprehensive plans.
Guidebook on Local Planning for Healthy Communities


Designing Better Places


Designing Better Places
Why do many towns and cities seem to have split personalities? The older areas, built before World War II, feel inviting. It’s possible to walk safely, the buildings are interesting to look at, and there are places where you’d like to sit and visit. In contrast, the majority of places built in the past 60 years feel totally different. Newer commercial areas are often accessible only by vehicle, and when you’re not inside a building, lingering doesn’t seem appealing.
Thanks to funding from the Appalachian Regional Commission, the North Carolina Rural Economic Development Division  has produced a video and two presentations on design issues that strive to answer why this is, how it happened, and what can be done to create more successful and inviting places that people and cars can share. First released on a CD, in 2005 it received the Award for Excellence from the Small Town & Rural Planning Division of the American Planning Association.
	Visit the Designing Better Places website for the full package of the video, presentations and materials.
