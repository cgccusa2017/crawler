Forestry

Mauka (upland) forests help sustain the island’s ecological balance and provide water for lowland agriculture and residential communities. To protect these lands, Hawaii’s Forest Reserve System was created back in 1903. Today, Hawaii’s Forest Reserve System comprises over 580,000 acres statewide and these natural resources are managed by the Department of Land and Natural Resources Forestry and Wildlife Division. Program areas cover watershed protection; native resources protection, including unique ecosystems and endangered species of plants and wildlife; outdoor recreation; and commercial forestry.
Revenue sources that can be reinvested into management of the Forest Reserve System include fees for leases, permits, mineral extraction, timber and non-timber forest products and other ecosystem services.
Forestry and Natural Resource Management Education
The UH Hilo College of Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resource Management offers the Bachelor of Science degree (BS) in six areas of specialization: Animal Science; Aquaculture; Coastal Resources & Watershed Management; Tropical Horticulture, and Tropical Plant Science & Agroecology. Academic subject certificates are also offered in Forest Resource Management & Conservation and Plant Tissue Culture.
Hawaii Community College offers its Forest TEAM Program which leads to a Certificate of Achievement (CA) and the Applied Science (AS) degree in Tropical Forest Ecosystem and Agroforestry Management.
Dryland Forest Protection
Our dryland forests are the most endangered dryland forests in the world. The Hawaii Island Native Seed Bank Cooperative is working to reverse losses. This is a collaboration funded by the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization and administered by The Hawaii Forest Institute.
Commercial Forestry
Commercial forestry operations are largely limited in Hawaii to plantation-style forestry (trees grown specifically for harvest) rather than logging native forests. In 2012, Tradewinds Forest Products LLC began harvesting eucalyptus trees from its 14,000 acres along the Hamakua Coast, storing the trees in Kawaihae before being shipped to Asia. Tradewinds also plans to supply eucalyptus logs to the future Hu Honua Bioenergy power plant.
Working with landowners on improving stewardship, Hawaiian Legacy Hardwoods is growing and preserving koa and other rare hardwoods.

Food

According to the 2010 County of Hawaii Agriculture Development Plan, our variable climates and varying elevations create unlimited potential for crops or livestock. This island is roughly the size of Connecticut in land area. Its daytime temperatures seldom reach 90ºF and low night temperatures rarely fall below 60º F, with extreme upper elevations excepted. Rainfall, the principal water source, varies from annual averages exceeding 200 inches on mid-elevations of the windward side to less than 4 inches on the leeward coastal plain.
 
The Hawaii County Food Self Sufficiency Baseline Study 2012 maps (GIS) agricultural activity islandwide and reveals the location and type of farming occurring within each region of the island. Hawaii’s agricultural products, both edible and non-edible, are grown for local consumption and for export. Vegetable crops, taro, tropical fruits, banana, papaya, aquaculture and specialty food crops account for 10,400 acres of active agricultural land use.
 
The island is home to several existing and several more planned commercial kitchens to support value-added food products.

Fisheries

 
Aquaculture and Fisheries Development
Kevin Hopkins, Ph.D. UH Hilo Professor of Aquaculture, is the Director of the Pacific Aquaculture and Coastal Resources Center (PACRC) leading innovative programs of research, education and extension services.  PACRC is the University of Hawaii Sea Grant College Program’s Center of Excellence in Sustainable Aquaculture.
New technologies have resulted in considerable expansion of Hawaii’s fledging aquaculture industry over the past decade. Most of Hawaii Island’s commercial mariculture ventures are tenants at the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA) in Kona.
 

Big Island Abalone – 10-acre aquafarm at NELHA producing premium stock Ezo (Japanese Northern) abalone
Blue Ocean Mariculture – premium, sashimi-grade kampachi
High Health Aquaculture – fast-growing, disease-resistant broodstock marine shrimp
Indo-Pacific Sea Farms – commercial production of reef-dwelling organisms
King Ocean Farm – produces superior quality hirame, a Japanese cold water flounder, ogo, moi and milkfish
Kona Coast Shellfish – broodstock, spawn and larvae, and seed production for Pacific oysters, Manila clams and Gallo mussels
Kona Cold Lobsters – imports and rejuvenates live lobsters and crabs
Moana Technologies – developing superior-bred shrimp broodstock
Ocean Rider – world’s first commercial seahorse farm
Royal Hawaiian Sea Farms – commercially produces ogo (edible sea vegetables)
Shrimp Improvement Systems Hawaii – commercial symbiotic co-production of Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) shrimp broodstock and clam seed
Taylor Shellfish – NELHA nursery for juvenile mollusks during critical early growth periods
Troutlodge Marine Farms Kona – specializing in black cod (butterfish) and moi

Anchored since 1959 by the prestigious Hawaiian International Billfish Tournament (HIBT), the island enjoys a legendary reputation for sportfishing. Honokohau Small Boat Harbor houses Kona’s charter fishing fleet with 262 moorings, three ramps, fuel facility and restaurants. A smaller number of charter boats and commercial vessels are also housed in Hilo at Reed’s Bay and the Wailoa Sampan Basin and Boat Harbor, and in Kawaihae at the Kawaihae Small Boat Harbor.
