Targeted IndustriesHome Why Nebraska? Targeted Industries








If Nebraska had a resume,
this would be the “Special Skills” section.



What is a targeted industry?
For Nebraska, this term describes groupings of companies within a single given industry that play to our strengths. For example, our abundant and low-cost utilities are attractive to data centers. And where these companies may have common competitive advantages and needs, they also complement each other, drawing productive benefit from their mutual proximity and connections.
Why are they important?
Targeting certain industries facilitates steady, yet robust regional and national growth and helps Nebraska secure a strong competitive foothold within the global economy. Our targeted industries program works to align all entities to best meet the needs of an industry. This includes public (Nebraska’s departments of Education and Labor, etc.), private, and non-profit institutions fully cooperating for the economic benefit of all targeted industries and the region as a whole.


Targeted Industries
Agribusiness and Food Processing 


Where better than in the “breadbasket of the world” to build a collective of companies whose expertise is to meet…and exceed…the growing, changing demands of the world’s agricultural and food source needs by challenging the boundaries of traditional agricultural practices and quality food products. Nebraska is continually exploring new frontiers as it relates to growing, cultivating, and adding value to foods that appeal to palates worldwide. Consider Suji’s Cuisine as one of many Nebraska converts.


Biosciences


The life sciences industry is thriving in Nebraska. Thanks to our workforce’s flair for technology and our incentive programs, the industry is attracting tremendous interest from a growing number of international companies wanting to expand.
Learn more at bionebraska.org.


Advanced Manufacturing 


Manufacturing is our state’s second largest economic driver. So it’s no secret we generate growth and retention in this industry. And the Nebraska Manufacturing Advisory Council (NeMAC) is at the helm.
Learn more at nebraskamanufacturing.com.


Renewable Energy


Nebraska is a gold mine of untapped energy, concentrating its “Green Power” into biofuels and wind, solar, and geothermal energy. We’re the second-largest ethanol-producing state in the U.S. and the largest west of the Missouri River. We rank sixth among the top ten states for potential wind energy resources. And our average 223 days of annual sunshine, combined with our strategic geographic location, are advantageous to both solar manufacturers and suppliers.


Financial Services


Insurance companies and financial institutions have a storied history here in Nebraska with many serving needs as far back as the 1880s. Nebraska ranks second in the U.S. in total size of assets held by insurance companies, of which more than 180 call home. Additionally, the nation’s largest privately-held bank holding company, First National Bank of Omaha, is headquartered here.


IT and Data Services


Nebraska is aggressively targeting the information technology industry and, more specifically, data centers. We have sites identified for all sizes of data center operations. Nebraska communities also have unique incentives for other new or expanding IT and data service business projects.
Learn more at nebraskatech.org.


Health and Medical Services


This is our largest industry cluster in terms of employment. The University of Nebraska Medical Center, for example, is recognized regionally for its outstanding programs and services and could easily become a national destination for patients seeking specialized health services.


Business Services


Another significant industry cluster for Nebraska, employment-wise, is Business Services where 21,000 of 65,000 jobs are in skilled and semi-skilled professions, including legal and accounting services, printing services and other business/support/security services.


Tourism and Hospitality


The Nebraska Tourism Commission has created nationwide awareness about Nebraska’s main attractions and hidden gems through guided media tours. And tourism-centered businesses are opening here as never before while more visitors discover The Good Life.
Learn more at visitnebraska.com/industry.


Transportation and Logistics


Interstate 80, arguably the nation’s busiest intercontinental highway, stretches 482 miles across the state. In addition, seven north/south highways bisect Nebraska. Supply chain and logistics management companies have discovered what railroad and trucking firms have long known: The best place for business is in the middle of everywhere.
Learn more at nebraskalogisticscouncil.org.


Call Centers and e-Commerce


Our state’s well-established base of call centers and e-commerce businesses is evidenced by a high employment percentage in these areas. A call center sub-cluster has been growing steadily during the past five years—much of it tied to customer service in business services and IT and data services industries. The e-commerce category significantly overlaps with other industry clusters, as well, including IT and retail.

SRI International Reports


The Nebraska Department of Economic Development contracted with SRI International to provide a detailed assessment of Nebraska’s economic development ecosystem. Included in this assessment are analyses of targeted industries in Nebraska, the Nebraska Advantage Act and other incentive programs, Nebraska’s workforce, and infrastructure. The following report, “Nebraska’s Next Economy: Goals, Policies and Practices for the Economic Development Ecosystem,” is the result of that contract. In addition to the analysis of ecosystem, the report suggests goals and best practices for improving the state’s ecosystem.

Nebraska Labor Availability, Skill and Training Studies


Since 2013, the Nebraska Departments of Economic Development and Labor collaborated on surveys designed to measure labor availability and employer needs throughout Nebraska.
The Bureau of Business Research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln also produced skills gap reports based on the results from data received from individuals and employers in Nebraska. These reports summarize information about job skills in Nebraska and whether skills gaps are present.
More than a dozen of the State’s employment centers are covered in these studies. Access all the reports here.
