B. Cookies
Cookies are simple text files stored on your web browser 
					to provide a means of distinguishing among
					users of this web site. 
					The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet web 
					sites. To better serve you, we occasionally use "session 
					cookies" to enhance or customize your visit to this web 
					site. Session cookies can be created automatically on the 
					device you use to access this state 
					agency web site, and generally do not contain
					personal information and 
					do not compromise your privacy or security. We may use the 
					cookie feature to store a randomly generated identifying tag 
					on the device you use to access this web site. Depending 
					upon your system settings, session cookies may be erased 
					during operation of your browser or when your browser is 
					closed. 

					You may be able to personalize your computer with respect to 
					this web site and permit a "persistent cookie" to be stored 
					on your computer's hard drive. If not currently available, 
					this option may be available in the future. A persistent 
					cookie would allow the web site to tailor information 
					presented to you based on your past needs and interests. ESD 
					would use persistent cookies only with your permission.

					The software and hardware you use to access the web site 
					allows you to refuse new cookies or delete existing cookies. 
					Refusing or deleting these cookies may limit your ability to 
					take advantage of some features of this web site.
C. Information Collected When You E-mail or Complete a 
					Transaction 
During your visit to this web site you may send an e-mail 
					to ESD. Your e-mail address and the contents of your message 
					will be collected. The information collected is not limited 
					to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic 
					information formats included in the message. Your e-mail 
					address and the information included in your message will be 
					used to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to 
					improve this web site, or to forward your message to another 
					State agency for appropriate action. Your e-mail address is 
					not collected for commercial purposes and the ESD is not 
					authorized to sell or otherwise disclose your e-mail address 
					for commercial purposes.

					During your visit to this web site you may complete a 
					transaction such as a survey, registration, or order form. 
					The information, including personal 
					information, volunteered by you in completing the 
					transaction is used by ESD to operate ESD'
s programs, which 
					include the provision of goods, services, and information. 
					The information collected by ESD may be disclosed by ESD for 
					those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the 
					nature and terms of the transaction in which the information 
					was submitted.

					Unless for a children's contest, ESD does not knowingly 
					collect personal information 
					from children or create profiles of children through this 
					web site. Users are 
					cautioned, however, that the collection of
					personal information 
					submitted in an e-mail will always be treated as though it 
					was submitted by an adult or with parental approval and 
					supervision, and may, unless exempted from access by federal 
					or State law, be subject to public access. The Agency 
					strongly encourages parents and teachers to be involved in 
					children's Internet activities and to provide guidance 
					whenever children are asked to provide 
personal information on-line.
D. Information and Choice
As noted above, ESD does not collect any
					personal information 
					about you unless you provide that information voluntarily by 
					sending an e-mail, responding to a survey, or completing an 
					on-line form. You may choose not to send us an e-mail, 
					respond to a survey, or complete an on-line form. While your 
					choice not to participate in these activities may limit your 
					ability to receive specific services or products through 
					this web site, it will not normally have an impact on your 
					ability to take advantage of other features of the web site, 
					including browsing or downloading information.
E. Disclosure of Information Collected Through This 
					Web Site 
The collection of information through this web site and 
					the disclosure of that information are subject to the 
					provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act. ESD 
					will only collect personal 
					information through this web site or disclose
					personal information 
					collected through this web site if the 
user has consented to the collection or 
					disclosure of such personal 
					information. The voluntary disclosure of
					personal information to 
					ESD by the user, whether 
					solicited or unsolicited, constitutes consent to the 
					collection and disclosure of the information by ESD for the 
					purposes for which the user 
					disclosed the information to ESD, as was reasonably 
					ascertainable from the nature and terms of the disclosure.

					However, ESD may collect or disclose 
personal information without consent if the 
					collection or disclosure is: (1) necessary to perform the 
					statutory duties of ESD, or necessary for ESD to operate a 
					program authorized by law, or authorized by state or federal 
					statute or regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order or 
					by law; (3) for the purpose of validating the identity of 
					the user; or (4) of 
					information to be used solely for statistical purposes that 
					is in a form that cannot be used to identify any particular 
					person.

					Further, the disclosure of information, including
					personal information, 
					collected through this web site is subject to the provisions 
					of the Freedom of Information Law and the Personal Privacy 
					Protection Law.

					information to federal or state law enforcement 
					authorities to enforce its rights against unauthorized 
					access or attempted unauthorized access to ESD's information 
					technology assets.

					services provided through this web site, will be retained 
					for several backup cycles and then destroyed unless relevant 
					audit, documentation requirements have not been met or 
					unless appropriate review and verification has been 
					completed. Information, including 
					personal information, that you submit in an 
					e-mail or when you complete a survey, registration form, or 
					order form is retained in accordance with the records 
					retention and disposition schedule established for the 
					records of the program unit to which you submitted the 
					information. Information concerning these records retention 
					and disposition schedules may be obtained through the 
					Internet privacy policy contact listed in this policy.
G. Access to   Correction of Personal Information 
					Collected via this Web Site
Any user may submit a request to ESD to determine whether 
					personal information pertaining to that user has been 
					collected through this web site. Any such request shall be

					acknowledge the receipt of the request in writing, stating 
					the approximate date when the request will be granted or 
					denied, which date shall not be more than thirty (30) days

					pursuant to the user's 
					request, the privacy compliance officer shall inform the

  Overview



  Overview
The Freedom of Information Law (“FOIL”), Article 6 (Sections 84-90) of the NYS Public Officers Law, provides the public right to access records maintained by government agencies with certain exceptions. 
“Record” means any information kept, held, filed, produced or reproduced by, with, or for this agency, in any physical form whatsoever including, but not limited to, reports, statements, examinations, memoranda, opinions, folders, files, books, manuals, pamphlets, forms, papers, designs, drawings, maps, photos, letters, microfilms, computer tapes or disks, rules, regulations or codes.
Learn more about records access and Open FOIL NY.

  Request Records



  Request Records
Use the Open FOIL NY online form:

Mail a written request to:

Empire State Development
Records Access Officer
633 3rd Ave - 37th Floor
New York, NY 10017
E-mail a written request to: FOIL@esd.ny.gov
Fax a written request to: (212) 803-3775
Submit a request for records in person:
Our main offices are located at 633 3rd Ave - 37th Floor, New York, NY. Upon entering the building, advise Security Staff at the front desk that you would like to request records from Empire State Development. Security Staff will contact the Records Access Office, and a staff member will provide assistance.  Please be advised records require review prior to disclosure. As a result, documents and records will not be immediately available.

  FOIL Process



  FOIL Process
Within five business days of the receipt of a written request for a record reasonably described, we will send you a letter either: making such record available; denying such request in writing; or furnishing a written acknowledgment of the receipt of such request.  If you have not received a letter within five business days, please contact us at FOIL@esd.ny.gov.
An acknowledgment letter will provide you with an estimate of when the records you request will be available, which shall be reasonable under the circumstances of the request. This date is determined by the number of documents you request, their format, their availability, the time it takes to redact any information that cannot be disclosed pursuant to FOIL, the time it takes to assemble the documents, and other factors. 
If the records you request require a fee to be paid, you will be notified prior to the records being released to you.  Unless a different fee is otherwise prescribed by statute, Public Officers Law §87(1) authorizes an agency to charge a fee of 25¢ per copy for copies of records up 9”x 14”, or the actual cost of reproducing a record. In determining the actual cost of producing a record, an agency may include only:
an amount equal to the hourly salary attributed to the lowest paid agency employee who has the necessary skill required to prepare the requested record(s), if at least two hours of agency employee time is needed to prepare a copy of the record(s) requested;
the actual cost of the storage devices or media provided to the person making the request in complying with such request; and
the actual cost to the agency of engaging an outside professional service to prepare a copy of a record, but only when an agency's information technology equipment is inadequate to prepare a copy, if such service is used to prepare the copy.
Once the requested records are prepared, you may receive the records via email, fax, paper, CD/DVD, or USB.  Records are available for inspection or copying, by appointment, at the Records Access Officer’s business office (633 3rd Ave, 37th Floor, New York, NY 10017), during the hours 9 a.m. through 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. through 4 p.m. on every day that ESD is open for business. You may schedule an appointment for in-person inspection of records by emailing FOIL@esd.ny.gov.





Next Section

Continue 


  Right to Appeal



  Right to Appeal
Under provisions of the Public Officers Law you may appeal a FOIL determination.  If you desire to submit such an appeal, you must do so within 30 days of the written response to your FOIL request. Please include a copy of the original request for records and a copy of the FOIL response letter you received along with your appeal letter.
An appeal to the Records Appeals Officer must be made via email to foilappeal@esd.ny.gov or in writing addressed to:
Records Appeals Officer
Empire State Development
633 3rd Ave
37th Floor
New York, NY 10017
You will be informed in writing of the decision within ten business days of our receipt of such an appeal.  Please indicate the FOIL Request Number when corresponding on this subject.

  Helpful Tips 



  Helpful Tips 
For more information about FOIL, please visit the New York State Committee on Open Government’s website.
When submitting a FOIL request:
Be as specific as possible in describing the requested records. Include relevant dates, names, descriptions, etc. See suggested language for a FOIL request from the Committee on Open Government.
Specify whether you would like to inspect the records or have copies of the records sent to you.
If records are available, specify how you want them sent, i.e., via US mail, e-mail or fax. We may choose to send the records by U.S. mail, if you have requested a large volume of records, for security or other important reasons. We will notify you of any charge for reproducing such records before they are sent to you.
Include your e-mail, mailing address and fax number, as well as a telephone number where you can be reached during business hours, if it is necessary to clarify your request.
Please note that the agency is not required to create a new record in response to FOIL requests.
