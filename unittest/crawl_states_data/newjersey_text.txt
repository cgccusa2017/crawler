Business Tax Incentives 















Home  Business Assistance  Business Tax Incentives 















BUSINESS TAX INCENTIVES TO HELP COMPANIES GROW 



Thinking about starting, relocating or growing a business? New Jersey offers powerful business tax incentives that can help you take your company to the next level.Created by the New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013, the Grow New Jersey Assistance Program (Grow NJ) and the Economic Redevelopment and Growth Program (ERG) have helped new and relocating companies create thousands of new jobs here, while helping New Jersey companies invest and grow in the State.We know you’ll find our tax incentives very competitive with programs offered by neighboring states.





























GROW NEW JERSEY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (GROW NJ) 



A powerful job creation and retention program, Grow NJ helps qualified companies, both large and small, blossom in New Jersey.Companies in all industries may qualify for tax breaks under the Grow NJ Assistance Program. Technology start-ups (including biotech companies) and manufacturers may qualify for tax incentives by creating as few as 10 full-time jobs or retaining 25 full-time jobs. Companies in targeted industries – transportation, defense, energy, logistics, life sciences, technology, health and finance – may qualify by creating as few as 25 new jobs or retaining 35 jobs.Tax credits for qualified projects range from $500 to $5,000 per job, per year, over 10 years. A number of bonus credits, each ranging from $250 to $5,000 per job, per year, may be available if the project meets certain requirements, such as location in an urban area, or high job-creation levels. Maximum awards can reach as high as $15,000 per job, per yearIn Garden State Growth Zones (Camden, Trenton, Passaic, Paterson and Atlantic City) and 8 South Jersey counties, minimum full-time employment requirements are 1/4 lower and minimum capital investment requirements are 1/3 lower. Projects may qualify by either creating or retaining full-time jobs.The highest levels of base credits are for projects located in Garden State Growth Zones, Urban Transit Hub Municipalities and “mega projects”.

ECONOMIC REDEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH 



ERG provides incentive grants to developers and businesses to address revenue gaps in development projects, defined as having insufficient revenues to support the project debt service under a standard financing scenario. It can also apply to projects that have a below market development margin or rate of return.For commercial projects, incentive grant reimbursement of up to 20% of total project cost is available, with a bonus of 20% available for projects in Garden State Growth Zones. Therefore, the total tax credit may equal up to 40% of total project costs, not to exceed an average of 85% of the project’s annual incremental revenues. Additional requirements, including a comprehensive net benefit analysis to verify that the revenues the State receives will be greater than the incentive, apply to commercial projects under ERG.










































BOND FINANCING, DIRECT LOANS AND MORE 



New Jersey also offers a variety of other programs to help companies here flourish, including: low-cost financing through tax-exempt bonds; direct loans; and, loan participations/guarantees. Plus, the State offers specialized programs to support emerging technology and biotech companies.For more information about Grow NJ, ERG and other programs to support your business, visit the New Jersey Economic Development Authority website.

Foreign Trade Zones 



Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) are secure geographical areas located within or near United States ports that are treated by U.S. Customs as if they were located outside national borders. This can be very helpful to companies because it gives them the ability to keep costs down by deferring payment of duties until goods leave an FTZ.New Jersey has five Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) strategically located throughout the state.FTZ #44 Mt. Olive, Morris CountyFTZ #49 Port Newark/Elizabeth Marine TerminalFTZ #142 Port of Salem, Salem County; Millville Airport, Cumberland CountyFTZ #200 Mercer County Airport (Trenton)FTZ # 235 Lakewood Township, Ocean CountyFTZ #49 at the Port Newark/Elizabeth Marine Terminal is one of the largest contiguous Foreign Trade Zones in the United States. Situated on 2,075 acres, FTZ #49 sponsors nine active Foreign Trade subzone operators that are involved with: manufacturing; pharmaceuticals; petroleum products; specialty chemicals; fragrances; and, other importers/distributors.
















You Can Fly Almost Anywhere From Here 



New Jersey gives business travelers, and companies that need to move cargo unparalleled access to destinations and connections almost anywhere in the world, by air.
Travelers in the State have access to daily non-stop flights to 110 U.S. cities and 130 international destinations via Newark Liberty International Airport and other nearby airports.
The combined airports in the New Jersey/New York metropolitan area create the largest airport system in the United States, the second largest in the world in terms of passenger traffic, and largest in the world in terms of total flight operations.
Newark Liberty is a major hub for travelers, as well as for express carriers like FedEx Express, which occupies three buildings on 2 million square feet of airport property. The airport’s strategic location, adjacent to Port Newark/Elizabeth and Foreign Trade Zone #49, gives companies the ability to access fast and efficient air-sea connections.
More than 30 airlines operate flights out of Newark Liberty, including United Airlines, the airport’s primary carrier. Spirit Airlines offers flights to U.S. destinations and Air Canada offers flights to Toronto from Atlantic City International Airport. Frontier Airlines offers non-stop domestic flights daily from Trenton Mercer Airport. Plus, another 43 public-use airports also are located in New Jersey.
So, whether your business takes you or your products places across the country or around the world, you’ll want your company in New Jersey.
















































One of America's Busiest Seaports 



New Jersey is home to the Port of New York and New Jersey, the 3rd busiest seaport in North America and the largest maritime cargo center on the East Coast, offering quick and easy transport of goods to national and international markets.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey manages the deep water ports of Newark, Elizabeth and Bayonne. Combined with the Authority’s regional air cargo network, they serve as a North American gateway for international freight as well as a leading hub for domestic cargo.The Port handles every type of cargo imaginable, including: containers; roll-on/roll-off automobiles (Ro-Ro); liquid and dry bulk; breakbulk; and, specialized project cargo. Fifty-four container cranes stand ready to handle those and all other types of cargo. Three port companies supply floating derricks, including the largest on the East Coast.The Port also hosts freight forwarders, brokers, financial firms, specialized export packers and other services. They move cargo efficiently and quickly from the Port to their next destinations by road or rail, including the ExpressRail system, which provides direct ocean-to-rail intermodal capabilities with on-dock rail lines.
















Ready For The Future 



In 2016, huge vessels known as neo-Panamax ships began traversing the widened and deepened Panama Canal. To ensure New Jersey’s ports can accommodate these super-containerships, major capital projects have been underway at our ports to ensure they are ready for future trade activity.For example, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey embarked on a $1.3 billion project to raise the clearance of the Bayonne Bridge at Port Newark/Elizabeth. The project, which began in 2013, pushed the bridge’s clearance up to 215 feet to accommodate the larger neo-Panamax ships coming from Asia to the East Coast through the expanded Panama Canal. As of June 2017, ultra-large containerships carrying up to 18,000 tonnage equivalency units (TEUs) have been authorized to navigate beneath the bridge.In South Jersey, a new state-of-the-art marine terminal opened at the Paulsboro Marine Terminal on the Delaware River. The 190-acre facility was the first new marine terminal to be constructed on the Delaware River in over 30 years, significantly increasing shipping capacity.If you’re interested in connecting to the world by sea, New Jersey’s ports are the place to be.
