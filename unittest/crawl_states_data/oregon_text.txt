Opportunity Zones
In 2018, the U.S. Treasury made opportunity zone designations across the country to encourage long-term investments through a federal tax incentive. Governor Brown's nomination resulted in 86 qualified opportunity zones in Oregon.
What Are Opportunity Zones?
Opportunity Zones can deliver significant tax savings on medium- to long-term investments in economically disadvantaged communities. This new tax incentive pertains to both the capital gains invested initially through a qualified opportunity fund, as well as capital gains earned for the investor from businesses or projects in a zone.
Each zone consists of an entire census tract, as established  for the decennial U.S. Census. Tracts vary in size but generally align with population density. Oregon has 834 census tracts, more than 300 of which were eligible by meeting the definition of a "low income community" in terms of median family incomes or poverty rates. Oregon could nominate up to 86 zones, as each state was allowed up to 25% of its low income communities for designation.
The designations are in effect until December 31, 2028, and offer a predictable basis for private investment decisions over several years. Current federal law provides no means to change or add zones. As such, Oregon's nomination process entailed thorough analysis of all relevant census tracts for their potential and usefulness, as well as extensive outreach to the general public, federally recognized Indian Tribes, local governments, and other parties over a 3-month period. Aside from the opportunity zone nomination process, state government does not have an ongoing, official role under federal law. Nevertheless, Business Oregon is exploring ways to partner with others in furthering the use of zones for the benefit of Oregon communities.

What are the Tax Advantages?
The private capital for projects or businesses in a qualified opportunity zone will arise primarily from the unrealized capital gains of U.S. taxpayers—that is, the increased value of assets (stocks, land, etc.) since they were originally purchased by the individual or corporation currently holding the asset. When an asset is sold and the gains realized, an income tax liability is normally generated.
With the opportunity zone incentive, the capital gains arising from sale to an unrelated person that are then transferred into a qualified opportunity fund within 180 days of being realized will have their tax liability delayed or deferred until December 31, 2026, at the latest. The taxpayer decides how much of his/her newly realized gains to invest, when to sell or exit that investment, or even whether to invest other moneys alongside.
In addition to deferring income taxes, by the time the investment of tax-deferred capital gains in the opportunity zone is sold or the end of 2026, whichever is earlier:

The amount subject to taxes shrinks by 10%in that the basis in the investment increasesif the investment has been held for at least five years.
If held for at least seven years in total, the basis increases by an additional 5% pts (15% in total).
The amount subject to taxes is effectively the fair market value of the investment, if it has declined in value.

If the investment of tax-deferred capital gains appreciates after having been held for at least 10 years, then those new capital gains earned in the zone are themselves completely tax free. Otherwise, the net income or proceeds generated by a zone investment are taxable.
Investors seeking to maximize the after tax return on their tax deferred gains could put money into qualified opportunity zones anywhere in the country, or they might be able to choose qualified opportunity funds that have a regional or other type of emphasis. Despite sharing some common geography, these tax benefits work quite differently from New Market Tax Credits, or for that matter, from any other federal program or incentive. Certain critical details are addressed with draft regulations and other guidance from the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
What Are Opportunity Funds?
A qualified Opportunity Fund is the required vehicle to invest into Opportunity Zones. More information on opportunity funds.
The information here is for public education. Every effort has been made to correctly use the best, most up-to-date data, but the state cannot guarantee complete accuracy, and under no circumstances is this information warranted for investment, tax planning, or any other reason. The information contained here should not be used as the basis of any decision with financial or other consequences, and regardless, working with a qualified tax advisor is recommended.

Export Promotion Program

 

Entering New Markets
Participating in international trade shows and trade missions is among the most effective ways for companies to enter into new international markets or expand their visibility in existing markets. Trade shows offer the opportunity to meet potential buyers, test market interest, and evaluate the competition. A trade mission can be a cost-effective way to meet potential distributors and buyers, secure licensing agreements, and explore joint venture opportunities.
Funding Available
Funded in part through a grant with the U.S. Small Business Administration, money is available to assist Oregon small businesses seeking to begin or grow international sales.
Who is Eligible
Export Promotion Grants are awarded to eligible small businesses that meet the U.S. SBA's definition and can self-certify their eligibility. Small businesses are generally defined as those with 500 or fewer employees. Candidates must evaluate and certify their eligibility by printing and signing the two SBA forms, Self-Representation as an Eligible Small Business Concern and Debarment Certification Form (available in the Toolbox at the right).
Other qualifying criteria:

At least 75% of the company's total employees must be employed in Oregon

Maximum Dollar Value
Export Promotion Grants reimburse up to 50% of a company's eligible expenses up to $10,000. Eligible applicants may apply to receive up to three grants per federal fiscal year.
Supported Activities
Most export training and development activities are supported by the Export Promotion Program, though specific programs of activity must be developed in consultation with a global trade specialist. Examples of supported activities include:

Exhibition at a commercial international trade show

Ground transportation costs within the hosting locale
Registration fees for U.S. Commercial Service export seminars, workshops, or presentations associated with a given export development activity

Innovate & Create
The creation and adoption of new products, services and business models is a fundamental driver of economic prosperity. The young companies, universities and institutions behind those new products expand markets and sales, stimulating investment and ultimately creating jobs. 
Council & Board
To compete, Oregon must prioritize investment in research and development, technology commercialization, new product development, and entrepreneurship in urban and rural communities and with full participation by underrepresented populations. Quality job growth depends on a thriving startup ecosystem where research and development can transition into commercialized technology and job-creating companies.
Oregon InC
The Oregon Innovation Council (Oregon InC) was created to help entrepreneurs turn cutting-edge research into new companies. Its initiatives help open the door to hard-to-find capital; provide Oregon businesses with access to otherwise out-of-reach R&D; labs and researchers; and show established industries how innovation can revitalize their products and their profits. 
Oregon Growth Board
The Oregon Growth Board was created in the 2012 Legislative Session in an effort to spur more economic growth in Oregon. An important focus is placed on leveraging state resources improie the availablility of capital for Oregon-based high-growth companies. The board manages two sources of investment capital.

Classic Foods
City: Portland, OR County: Multnomah Senate District: 22 House District: 43




Farm to Plate: Artisan Food Business Grows the Old Fashioned Way



 With help from a $3.3 million Industrial Development Express Bond, Classic Foods managed to reinvest in an inner city neighborhood, revitalize an historical ice house and grow their food processing company.
Classic Foods manufacturers and distributes primarily artisan, custom-made ravioli to restaurants, hotels and institutions in Oregon and Southwest Washington. But it also produces other artisan specialty items including its own line of herbs and spices as well as nuts and dried fruits and also distributes imported Mediterranean and Asian food products.
Company president and founder Jake Greenberg started the company 29 years ago with $1,006. Greenberg sources many of his ingredients personally from local organic farmers, such as Stahlbush Island Farms in Corvallis, or local farmers markets (he was one of the founders of the Hollywood Farmers Market in Portland). In early 2013, Greenberg said the company was on the verge of inking a deal to supply custom-made, fresh pasta products for a large, specialty grocer in Portland.
Thanks to the $3.3 million from Business Oregon's Industrial Development Express Bond program and the help from West Coast Bank, the company was able to purchase and turn a 50,000-square-foot, former ice house in Northeast Portland's Woodlawn neighborhood into a LEED-certified, food processing facility and company headquarters.
The company has been expanding since the recession and has increased its ranks from 23 to 30 employees. It also provides public meeting space for neighborhood non-profit groups and community organizations in its facility.
"To have that (Industrial Development Express Bond) available was absolutely invaluable to me," Greenberg told a state legislative committee in March 2013. "It will save us something in the range of one half million dollars in interest. It really makes funds available to us to expand in the future and that is very much my intention."

Business Oregon Announces Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Awards
Today Business Oregon announced $4,118,800 in grants for one county and four city projects. These awards are from the state's 2018 second application round of funding. The primary objective of the CDBG program is the development of livable communities by expanding economic opportunities, providing decent housing, and creating suitable living environments, principally for persons of low and moderate income."These awards can make a big difference for Oregon communities, particularly smaller rural areas that can use a partner for large infrastructure investments," said Chris Harder, director of Business Oregon. "The projects set the stage for long-term economic growth and community health in rural Oregon."Business Oregon administers the state of Oregon's annual federal allocation of CDBG funds for non-metropolitan cities and counties. Urban cities and counties, and tribes are not included in the state's program as they receive CDBG funds directly from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.The following is the list of recipients in this round of funding.Public Works Projects: City of Willamina$495,900City of Elgin$476,400City of John Day$196,500Community Facility Projects: City of Dayville, Community Center$1,450,000Grant County, Domestic Violence Shelter$1,500,000More information on each of these projects, as well as full program information, is available on our web site.
Business Oregon, the state's economic development agency, invests in Oregon businesses, communities, and people to promote a globally competitive, diverse, and inclusive economy. The agency's services span rural community development and infrastructure financing; business retention, expansion and recruitment; export promotion and international trade; investments in industry research and development and entrepreneurship; small business assistance; and support for arts and cultural organizations.

READ FULL STORY 



Industrial Land & Infrastructure
Industrial land is one of the state's most valuable resources in terms of net contributions to the state's economy and tax base. The traded sector firms that locate on industrial land are an engine of expansion, spurring growth in the service sector and paying family wages to a broad spectrum of workers.
Find a Location
Already know what type of property you need? Business Oregon has partnered with other economic development organizations across the state in order to provide a database of certified sites, along with other available industrial land and buildings, at www.oregonprospector.com.
Shovel Ready Certification
Oregon's Shovel Ready Certification Program is recognized as one of the most comprehensive in the country. It is a rigorous program that is trusted by the market and has been a factor in many of the state's largest employment successes. Oregon's certified sites are ready for construction within six months or less and are verified "project-ready" for specific industry profiles.
Applications to the program are accepted in April and September each year by submitting a commitment letter and supplemental reports. Sites that have been Shovel Ready Certified must apply for recertification every two years. Recertification applications are accepted in January each year.
Industrial Development
The 2011 Legislature created the Economic Recovery Review Council (ERRC) and two programs that streamline the process to ready industrial lands for business. One program focuses on up to 10 projects per biennium that may be subjected to an expedited process when job creation, wage and other criteria are met. The second manages industrial areas regionally where between five and 15 areas planned and zoned for industrial use that have potential long-term job creation and meet other criteria that must be maintained for employment uses. Learn more >>
Brownfields
A brownfield is property where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by actual or perceived environmental contamination. Oregon's Brownfields programs range in activities from site assessment to cleanup for properties where known or suspected environmental contamination is a barrier to redevelopment. Learn more >>
Telecommunications
Business Oregon helps facilitate the deployment and utilization of telecommunications infrastructure to support innovation, create economic opportunities and build quality communities throughout Oregon.
Oregon has a world-class telecommunications infrastructure extending throughout the state. Multiple fiber optic backbone networks with diverse routing provide excellent network reliability and connectivity statewide. Learn more >>
For additional infrastructure information see the programs administered by the Infrastructure Finance Authority.

Benchmade Knife Company Inc
City: Oregon City, OR County: Clackamas Senate District: 20 House District: 39




Designer Knives Pay Dividends to Clackamas Manufacturer



 Triple-digit export growth has helped Oregon City's Benchmade Knife Company grow to 180 employees with customers in 40 nations around the globe.
Business Oregon helped support Benchmade with a grant from its Oregon Trade Promotion Program. The grant helped the company defray costs associated with its participation in a 2011 Defense and Security Industry trade show in South America. In addition, a company official traveled with Governor Kitzhaber and Business Oregon officials on their business development mission to Asia in September 2011.
Rob Morrison, Benchmade's director of marketing and strategic planning, says Benchmade's exports have grown more than 180% over the past three years. Approximately 35% of the company's exports go to Asia, with China and Japan leading the way. The company's top-of-the-line American-made knives, which cost up to $2,000 each, are particularly in demand in China.
"International growth is a key strategic focus for us, particularly in markets that have an appreciation for high-quality, U.S.-made products," Morrison, who joined the Governor on the trip to Asia, said.
The company set up shop in Clackamas, Oregon, in 1990 (it was originally founded in California in 1988). It introduced its Designer Series in 1991 with several custom designs being manufactured. By tapping into the custom knife makers' knowledge and combining it with our manufacturing expertise we were more readily able to offer more contemporary knife designs and innovations to the knife users.
Consecutive years of aggressive growth led to the next logical step in 1996 when Benchmade moved into its own 35,000 sq. ft. facility. A contemporary styled building complete with all of the modern equipment and amenities necessary to manufacture what has become recognized as a higher standard of specialty cutlery.
In 2009, the Portland Business Journal picked Benchmade as Manufacturer of the Year for the state of Oregon. That same year, the Business Journal also recognized Benchmade as one of Oregon's Most Admired Companies within the Manufacturing Companies division.
All Benchmade branded knives and cutting tools are designed, manufactured, and assembled in Oregon City. The company's workforce has grown more than 30% in the past three years.
According to the most recent market share data from SportScanInfo®, the sporting goods industry's leading source for business information, Benchmade's market share of premium folding knives priced at $70 and higher is more than 60%. That's almost four times larger than our next competitor. Additionally, Benchmade has won the prestigious Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence award for Knife of the Year 11 of the 14 years the award has existed, including the past three straight years.

Strategic Investment Program
The Strategic Investment Program (SIP) offers a 15-year property tax exemption on a portion of large capital investments. The program was created in the 1990s to induce large, capital-intensive facilities to locate and grow anywhere in Oregon.
What Projects Qualify
SIP projects must serve a "traded sector" industry. Oregon law defines "traded sector" as one in which "member firms sell their goods or services into markets for which national or international competition exists."
The project's cost must be at least $25 million in a rural area or $100 million otherwise. But as a practical matter to benefit from the program, the overall investment will need to be considerably bigger. The actual exemption is on property value in excess of a taxable portion, which starts at $100 million for all urban projects, while in rural areas:


Total Investment Costs
Initial Taxable Portion Amount*


Not more than $500 million
$25,000,000


Between $0.5 and $1.0 billion
$50,000,000


Greater than $1.0 billion
$100,000,000


*"Rural area"located entirely outside urban growth boundary of a city with a population of 40,000 or more at the time of state SIP application or in a Rural SIZ designated before October 5, 2015. Taxable portion is based on property's real market value and grows 3% p.a.
How Projects Get Approved
There are two options for an SIP project application:

Ad hoc approval. The county holds a public hearing and negotiates an agreement between the business and county and city (if applicable).
Strategic Investment Zone (SIZ). The zones are designed to provide a more streamlined local process. At any time, a county (and city) may submit a request through Business Oregon for the Business Oregon Commission to designate a Strategic Investment Zone.

Community Service Fee
Companies must also pay the respective county a community service fee as set by law. The fee is contained in the agreement with the business, which may include additional requirements on the business. The county must also sign a separate agreement with other local governments for distributing the fee.
Reporting Requirements
For any SIP project that is exempt in the prior tax year, the business must submit a report to Business Oregon detailing its employment and payroll. The report is used to evaluate the program's performance and provide estimates of state personal income tax revenue that may be shared with local governments.

Target Industry Groups Frequently Asked Questions & Answers



Advanced Manufacturing
Advanced Manufacturing includes innovative manufacturers who develop and utilize advanced materials in their products. The development and use of advanced materials means manufacturers will create more competitive, innovative products marketable globally. Oregon's advanced manufacturers are particularly competitive in the development and use of advanced metals. The metals industry has a long history in Oregon, and it continues to drive innovation of advanced materials in the state.
Advanced manufacturers increasingly turn to exports for growth. Advanced Manufacturing exports from Oregon have doubled in the past ten years. Export growth is not limited to one sector of Advanced Manufacturing either, Upstream Metals and Machinery, Aerospace and Defense, and Biomedical have all experienced tremendous export growth. 
Emerging sectors within Advanced Manufacturing include Aerospace and Defense, and Biomedical. Both industries are growing jobs, increasing their market shares nationally, and have tripled exports over the past ten years.
Upstream Metals & Machinery
Oregon has long been an innovator in metals manufacturing. Upstream Metals includes manufacturers of pipes, castings, plates, coils, and metal smelting and refining that are then used in a subsequent end-user product. Oregon is known for its advanced metals manufacturers, including those that work with titanium, like ATI Specialty Alloys & Components in Albany and Precision Castparts in Portland. Titanium is an important, highly-valued metal used in aerospace and biomedical products. Machinery manufacturers in Oregon specialize in the production of equipment used for heavy lift, material moving, pumping, metalworking, logging, and construction. Oregon machinery manufacturers are very export-oriented, shipping their advanced equipment all over the world.
Aerospace & Defense
Oregon's fastest growing Advanced Manufacturing sector is Aerospace and Defense, with 51% employment growth over the past 10 years. Oregon's Aerospace and Defense industry may not be as large and established as some other states', but it is clearly an expanding manufacturing sector in Oregon based on its outstanding employment growth, competitive market share gain, and industry innovation over the past 10 years. 
The Aerospace and Defense industry is present throughout Oregon. Boeing has a sizable presence in Portland, Erickson Air-Crane is in Southern Oregon, and Central Oregon is home to several small manufacturers. About a quarter of employment in aerospace and defense is in search, detection, and navigation instruments, which includes companies like FLIR Systems and Garmin.
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is another emerging sector of Aerospace and Defense in Oregon. Companies like Northwest UAV in McMinnville (the largest manufacturer of UAV propulsion systems in the U.S.), and Insitu in Hood River and Bingen (WA),  make Oregon well-positioned to grow its UAV industry. Oregon also boasts three FAA approved UAV test ranges in Pendleton, Tillamook, and Warm Springs that offer a diverse array of testing conditions.
Biomedical
Biomedical is an emerging Advanced Manufacturing industry in Oregon because of its employment and export growth, as well as it growing competitive market share in the U.S. Two sectors form the core of Biomedical in Oregonmedical equipment manufacturing and scientific research and development. Together, these account for about three quarters of employment in the industry.
Biomedical manufacturers are becoming increasingly reliant on exports for growth. Both medical equipment and pharmaceutical manufacturing tripled their exports between 2005 and 2015.
Service providers in Biomedical have found Oregon to be fertile ground for their research, with a talented and innovative workforce. The industry is supported by the Oregon Translational Research and Development Institute (OTRADI), a Business Oregon-supported Signature Research Center tasked with translating scientific research developed in Oregon's laboratories into commercial ventures.

Location Quotient is a ratio that shows an area's distribution of employment by industry compared to a reference or base area's distribution. The base area used in the Target Industry Group analysis was the U.S., except for rural Oregon location quotients, which used Oregon as the base area. A location quotient of 1.0 means the comparison area has the same distribution of industry employment as the base area. A location quotient greater than 1.0 means the comparison area has a larger concentration of industry employment than the base area.

NORPAC Foods Inc
City: Salem, OR County: Marion Senate District: 10 House District: 20




Expansion of Cold Storage Facilities Results in 35 New Jobs



 Thanks to help from state and local officials, two, long-time Oregon food processing companiesNORPAC Foods and Henningsen Cold Storageagreed in early 2013 to make a $25 million investment in Salem.
NORPAC Foods Inc., and Henningsen Cold Storage officials agreed to build a 225,000-square-foot cold storage warehouse in southeast Salem. NORPAC, a large fruit and vegetable processor, and Hillsboro-based Henningsen Cold Storage have done business together for many years.
The warehouse and office buildings are part of strategic plans to grow both companies' businesses and will be built on NORPAC-owned land. The warehouse, scheduled for completion in early 2014 and expected to employ 35 workers, would provide cold storage space for the adjacent NORPAC food packaging plant.
The city of Salem provided property tax breaks to the companies through an existing Enterprise Zone. In addition, Business Oregon recommended and the Oregon Department of Transportation approved, a $1 million Immediate Opportunity Fund grant to help fund $5.8 million of required infrastructure to nearby streets and sewers.
The two companies worked closely with officials from the Strategic Economic Development Corp. (SEDCOR) and the city of Salem to make the project happen.
In addition to the new cold storage facility, NORPAC also plans to move its corporate headquarters from Stayton, as well as a sales and marketing team in Lake Oswego, to a new 42,000-square-foot office in southeast Salem. That move is expected to bring 120 more NORPAC employees to Salem.
NORPAC has annual sales of $300-$500 million. Company officials see good future opportunities in export markets. Oregon's food processing industry employs more than 40,000 Oregonians at more than 1,400 companies and accounts for nearly $650 million in exports annually.
NORPAC has five plants in the Salem area, one in Hermiston and one in Quincy, Wash. The company employs about 1,300 people full-time, with many more seasonal workers coming on the job during harvests.

Oregon Tax Structure
Oregon Tax Abatements 
Measure 91



Oregons Incentives
Oregon offers globally competitive incentives to encourage business expansion.
Property Tax Abatement
Enterprise ZonesIn exchange for investing and hiring in an enterprise zone, businesses receive exemption from local property taxes on new plant and equipment for at least three years (but up to five years) in the standard program. In addition, many zones can offer special incentives for investments in qualifying rural facilities or in electronic commerce operations.
Strategic Investment Program (SIP)The program exempts a portion of very large capital investments from property taxes for 15 years. The program is available statewide.
Construction-in-ProcessUnfinished facility improvements may be exempt from local property taxes for up to two years while under construction with April 1 filing each year. In an enterprise zone, most authorized businesses enjoy a broader tax abatement using a different form.
Food Processing Machinery and Equipment  (M&E;)For five years starting in or before 2020, newly operational M&E; is exempt if certified by the Oregon Department of Agriculture. This exemption encompasses real or personal property used in the primary processing of many types of goods for human consumption with certain limitations.
State Income Tax
Oregon Investment AdvantageThis program helps businesses start or locate new types of operations in a number of Oregon counties by providing an income tax subtraction, potentially eliminating state income tax liability on new operations over several years after they begin.
Income tax credits and other information at Oregon Department of Revenue
Other Programs
Federal Opportunity ZonesThese new designations are designed to incentivize investments in low-income communities in exchange for tax benefits for investors.
Strategic Reserve Funda discretionary tool used for a variety of projects impacting economic development requiring an extensive vetting process, with the Governor making the final approval.
Oregon Business Expansion ProgramThis is a cash-based forgivable loan equivalent to the estimated increase in personal income tax revenue from new hiring.
Oregon New Market Tax Credit (NMTC) Programdelivers below-market-rate investment options to Oregon businesses and creates jobs in low-income communities. Applications are no longer being accepted.
Small Manufacturing Business Expansion ProgramThis is a cash-based forgivable loan for small manufacturing businesses' expansion projects.
Solar Development Incentive ProgramA program created by the 2016 Legislature that provides incentives to owners of photovoltaic energy systems that collect solar energy and distribute electricity.
Federal Work Opportunity Tax CreditCongress provides this incentive to private-sector companies for hiring individuals from target groups, for which the state of Oregon has instituted systems to expedite and facilitate documentation.
Film & Video IncentivesOregon offers programs to induce film and video productions:

Rebate on 20% of the production's Oregon-based goods and services
Additional cash payment of up to 16.2% of wages paid to production personnel
Unlike other states' programs, these film & video incentives are cash-based as opposed to tax credits. This simplifies and speeds up the process.

Northwood RV Manufacturing
City: La Grande, OR County: Union Senate District: 29 House District: 58




Outdoor RV Growing in Leaps and Bounds



 A northeastern Oregon recreational vehicle and camper manufacturer has grown significantly thanks in part to the help of Business Oregon over two decades.
Northwood Manufacturing, and its sister company Outdoors RV Manufacturing, Inc., employ 450 workers at two plants near La Grande. The company says it is the largest camper manufacturer in the nation and has become the fourth largest maker of RVs.
The company began in manufacturing travel trailers and campers in the early 1990s. Company owner Ron Nash purchased a nearby shuttered Fleetwood RV facility in May 2009. The first RVs rolled off the manufacturing line in the summer of 2009 and the combined revenues of both companies grew approximately $31 million that year to close to $100 million by 2013, company CEO Jim Jones told a legislative committee in March 2013.
The company's RV product lines include Back Country, Black Stone, Creek Side, Timber Ridge and Wind River. All sales are to independent RV dealers in the Pacific Northwest and Western Canada. The company sells about half of all its RVs to the Canadian market.
Business Oregon has assisted the company with four separate Oregon Business Development Fund (OBDF) loans in 1994, 1996, 2009 and 2013 respectively. The latest OBDF loan in April 2013 totaled $400,000 and helped finance the company's $1 million, 20,000-square-foot expansion of its RV manufacturing facilities. The expansion is expected to create 18, new full-time jobs over three years.
In March 2013, Jones told the Oregon Legislative committee that the company's fast growth had made it difficult to find enough workers and thus meant the company had to find as many manufacturing efficiencies as possible. The Oregon Business Development Fund backing helped the companies realize those efficiencies, Jones testified.
"The Oregon Business Development Fund has been a benefit to us from the standpoint of as the labor force maxes out we have to look at being more efficient," Jones testified.

Tax Credit Structure
The tax credits are realized over the course of seven years. The total tax credit is calculated as 39% of the total qualified investment. The qualified investment amount is not to exceed $8 million per project or $3.12 million in tax credits per project.

READ FULL STORY 



Industrial Land & Infrastructure
Industrial land is one of the state's most valuable resources in terms of net contributions to the state's economy and tax base. The traded sector firms that locate on industrial land are an engine of expansion, spurring growth in the service sector and paying family wages to a broad spectrum of workers.
Find a Location
Already know what type of property you need? Business Oregon has partnered with other economic development organizations across the state in order to provide a database of certified sites, along with other available industrial land and buildings, at www.oregonprospector.com.
Shovel Ready Certification
Oregon's Shovel Ready Certification Program is recognized as one of the most comprehensive in the country. It is a rigorous program that is trusted by the market and has been a factor in many of the state's largest employment successes. Oregon's certified sites are ready for construction within six months or less and are verified "project-ready" for specific industry profiles.
Applications to the program are accepted in April and September each year by submitting a commitment letter and supplemental reports. Sites that have been Shovel Ready Certified must apply for recertification every two years. Recertification applications are accepted in January each year.
Industrial Development
The 2011 Legislature created the Economic Recovery Review Council (ERRC) and two programs that streamline the process to ready industrial lands for business. One program focuses on up to 10 projects per biennium that may be subjected to an expedited process when job creation, wage and other criteria are met. The second manages industrial areas regionally where between five and 15 areas planned and zoned for industrial use that have potential long-term job creation and meet other criteria that must be maintained for employment uses. Learn more >>
Brownfields
A brownfield is property where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by actual or perceived environmental contamination. Oregon's Brownfields programs range in activities from site assessment to cleanup for properties where known or suspected environmental contamination is a barrier to redevelopment. Learn more >>
Telecommunications
Business Oregon helps facilitate the deployment and utilization of telecommunications infrastructure to support innovation, create economic opportunities and build quality communities throughout Oregon.
Oregon has a world-class telecommunications infrastructure extending throughout the state. Multiple fiber optic backbone networks with diverse routing provide excellent network reliability and connectivity statewide. Learn more >>
For additional infrastructure information see the programs administered by the Infrastructure Finance Authority.

Target Industry Groups Frequently Asked Questions & Answers



Forestry & Wood Products Industry
Oregon is the largest lumber producer in the U.S. With 30.5 million acres of forestlands, about 50% of the total landmass of the state is covered in forest. An internationally-recognized leader in wood product manufacturing, Oregon combines accessible raw materials with cutting-edge innovation to produce a diverse range of high quality, value-added wood products that are exported to every corner of the globe.
Innovation is imperative for Forestry and Wood Products to maintain its competitive position in the marketplace. Modern mills use nearly every fiber of wood. Laser scanning ensures the most productive use of the wood, while the rest is recovered and used in the production of engineered wood products, biomass power, or other secondary wood products. Technological advances allow for the use of smaller logs to create products that would have required larger logs decades ago.
Forestry and Wood Products employment is more concentrated in rural Oregon than any other of our Target Industry Groups. It is an important source of high-paying jobs for many rural communities, and the support and development of this industry group is vital to the economic prosperity of many rural Oregonians.
Forestry
Logging and support activities for forestry form the base of Oregon's forestry industry. Forestry has the largest location quotient of any industry in Business Oregon's Targeted Industry Groups, meaning it is very concentrated here and is, perhaps, the industry most unique to Oregon. It also is an industry that is significant to rural communities in Oregon, as forests tend to be located in rural parts of the state.
Oregon is known worldwide for its high quality softwoods, predominantly, Douglas fir, Oregon's official state tree. Most Oregon logs are purchased by wood product manufacturers in Oregon. As a result, demand for logs is tied to demand for wood products. Oregon's timber harvest today comes primarily from private timberlands. In 2014, 79% of Oregon's timber harvest came from private lands. Some logs from private lands are exported, but that market represents a very small share of total logs harvested in Oregon.
Wood Products
From dimensional lumber to plywood to ready-to-install windows and doors, Oregon's value-added wood products are world-renowned. Demand for Oregon wood products worldwide is on the rise, with exports increasing 44% between 2005 and 2015. Exports present a growth opportunity for this industry that has historically not exported a large percentage of its products.
Oregon is home to many leading wood and paper product manufacturers, including Weyerhaeuser, Georgia-Pacific, Roseburg Forest Products, and The Collins Companies. These companies and others are continually innovating and creating more efficient processes and better products to meet modern needs. One example is the work of D.R. Johnson in Riddle to bring cross laminated timber (CLT) products to market. D.R. Johnson is the first U.S. certified manufacturer of CLT in the country. CLT is an engineered wood product made of several layers of lumber, stacked crosswise, and glued and pressed together. CLT is strong enough that it can be used as an alternative to concrete, masonry, and steel in many commercial construction applications.

Rural Opportunity Initiative
The Rural Opportunity Initiative (ROI) is a collaborative strategy to build local environments supportive of entrepreneurs and small business. Through financial support, innovative partnerships, network creation, and a bevy of business development resources, ROI strengthens and unifies the entrepreneurial ecosystem within and across Oregon's rural communities.
The principle goal is to build a future economy that works for all of us. To achieve this, the initiative is proactively inclusive, led by impacted communities, redefining methods and metrics of evidence-based economic development, and focused on elevating the role of entrepreneurship in local economic development.
The Approach
Communities self-identify as champions and conveners for entrepreneurship. They are entrepreneur and demand driven. They determine their own needs and create their own solutions while building their own resources. The initiative supports communities with knowledge, networks, and provides financial and human capital to assist communities in advancing their project from one stage to the next, working towards a strengthened entrepreneurial ecosystem.

The entrepreneurship ecosystem is a set of factors that interact to create an environment that favors (or does not favor) development of entrepreneurs and small businesses. These factors are commonly referred to as the "Five Cs: Culture, Climate, Capacity, Connectivity, and Capital." The ROI works to strengthen these factors locally as well as throughout the state.


Initiative Values
Local, place-based strategies keeps the power within the community. The best people to decide the right approach for a community are the residents themselves. This approach builds local capacity while challenging economic development professionals across the state to be entrepreneur- and demand-driven.
Inclusive leadership and genuine partnership. Learning from Native Americans, women, and communities of color and embedding their perspectives in every step of the process; creating partnerships based on mutual respect and a shared vison are valued. Funding helps ROI communities proactively include diverse populations in leadership roles while building the capacity of all partners to provide culturally-responsive services.
Who is Participating
Eleven recipient communities were selected through a competitive grant process for their ability to build local capacity and bolster broad and inclusive support within their community. The communities collectively represent more than 14 counties, 20 cities, and elevate the work of more than 80 partners, ranging from universities, venture catalysts, and local Tribal governments to financial institutions, culturally-specific legacy organizations, youth-serving organizations, and more.
ROI Communities work in three stages of development:

Funding and Application Process
The Legislature provided $750,000 to Business Oregon for use toward ROI in the 2017-2019 biennium. Future program funds will be decided during the 2019 Legislative Session. Should additional funding be provided, Business Oregon will announce and post application forms and the process on this page. Sign up to receive Innovation & Entrepreneurship communications and stay up-to-date on the latest developments and future program opportunities.

Solar Development Incentive
The 2016 Legislature created the Solar Development Incentive (SDI) to encourage the development of solar energy projects in Oregon by providing a cash incentive per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated to owners of photovoltaic (PV) energy systems with a nameplate capacity of between 2 and 10 megawatts-alternating current output capacity (MWac). Qualified projects enrolled in the program can receive a monthly payment of $0.005 per kWh of electricity generated, for a period of  five years. This is a one-time enrollment incentive program that closed on January 2, 2017, and is no longer accepting applications.
Selected Projects
 Business Oregon approved 20 utility-scale solar energy projects to enroll in the new Solar Development Incentive program. The 20 projects represent 148.5MW of the total 150MW capacity and are mostly located in central, southern, and eastern Oregon.  Learn more about the project awards >>
Below are high-level details about the projects that applied:

55 applications received, 53 of which were eligible
293 MW of projects applied, 283 MW were eligible
Applicatons from 11 different solar developers from across the country
Applications' project geography was diverse and included the following regions

South Central (12 projects, 99 MW)
Central (5 projects, 50 MW)
Greater Eastern, North (2 projects, 8 MW)Greater Eastern, South (7 projects, 45 MW)
Mid-Valley (17 projects, 44 MW)
Metro (6 projects, 15 MW)
Northeast (1 project, 12 MW)
Southern (1 project, 10 MW)
Greater Eastern, North (2 projects, 8 MW)

Eligibility
A solar PV system was eligible if it:

is located in Oregon
has a nameplate capacity between two and 10 megawatts as measured in alternating current (MWac)
has a commercial operations date, as specified in a power purchase agreement, of January 1, 2016, or later
is either 

directly connected to the electrical system of an investor-owned utility or publicly-owned utility, or
indirectly connected to the electrical system of an investor-owned utility or publicly-owned utility in a manner that Business Oregon determines acceptable for program enrollees


has a revenue grade meter or other device that monitors and measures the quantity of energy generated by the solar PV energy system
meets any other siting, design, interconnection, installation, and electric output standards required by Oregon laws.
The program enrollee, including any business affiliated with the program enrollee, has not and will not exceed a 35MWac cumulative nameplate capacity of projects enrolled in the program.

Before enrolling eligible projects, Business Oregon worked with the Oregon Department of Energy to identify projects that, if not already generating electricity, were likely to begin generating electricity no later than January 2, 2018.
The SDI Handbook is intended to provide information about the program intent, applicability, and participation. 
For more information, program rules can be found in Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) 123.093. In the event that there is a discrepancy between language found in the Handbook and OAR 123.093, the language in OAR 123.093 overrides language in the Handbook.

Target Industry Groups Frequently Asked Questions & Answers



High Technology Industry
Home to the Silicon Forest, the state's concentration of High Technology companies has made a name for Oregon across the globe. Companies like Intel, Tektronix, and Mentor Graphics have long roots in the region and have spun-off hundreds of other startups. Today there are 4,184 high tech firms statewide. Oregon's robust high tech ecosystem provides a competitive advantage for any growing technology company.
The largest cluster of Oregon technology companies is located around the city of Hillsboro, anchored by Intel's largest facility in the world and supported by a highly skilled and experienced workforce. Oregon is one of a handful of states in the U.S. that specializes in semiconductor manufacturing. This buildup of talent and infrastructure related to Semiconductors and Electronics has contributed to the development of the fast-growing Software and Information Technology (IT) industry as well. 
Semiconductors & Electronics
Semiconductors and Electronics is Oregon's largest manufacturing sector in employment, exports, and contribution to state GDP. It's importance to the state's economy cannot be overstated, and it has played an important role in the development of the fast-growing Software and IT industry.
Oregon is home to Intel's largest global manufacturing facility, which specializes in research and development and the manufacture of some of the world's most advanced microprocessors. Intel is the largest private employer in Oregon.
The quality of the Semiconductors and Electronics workforce in Oregon is excellent, with many skilled engineers, technicians, and managers. Combined with a developed supply chain and the state's low energy costs and low cost of doing business, Oregon is a globally competitive location for Semiconductors and Electronics.
Software & IT
Software and IT is one of the fastest growing industry groups in Oregon, with more than 50% employment growth over the past 10 years. Nearly 3,700 Software and IT establishments call Oregon home. Software and IT companies in Oregon specialize in the areas of design, digital & social media, financial solutions, open source, training, mobile applications, and health care.
Software and IT companies are growing in Oregon due to the attractiveness of the state to younger workers and the lower cost of doing business here compared to other west coast Software and IT hubs. The industry has benefitted greatly from the presence of Semiconductors and Electronics in the state, which has helped supply and attract talented designers and engineers.
Data centers are included in Software and IT, and their growth in Oregon has provided much needed jobs in rural parts of the state. Oregon has a strong competitive advantage for data centers due to its low energy costs and temperate climate.

Oregon Regions
Oregon's of course a pretty incredible place to live. Oregon's diverse landscape, people and culture can provide something for everyone. You can surf on the Oregon coast, wade its tide pools and enjoy the bounty of Dungeness crab. Oregon's Willamette Valley is home to the finest Pinot Noir vineyards, and incredible rivers and public gardens. The Greater Portland area is a nice niche between big city and small town feel and the commercial center of the state, with an engaging urban environment providing arts and culture attractions year-round. The high desert of central Oregon is a beautiful natural attraction, with snow sports drawing travelers in the winter and incredible golf and hiking in the summer. Eastern Oregon provides both wide open spaces and incredible mountains and lakes, as well as cutting edge agriculture, clean technology and targeted tech opportunities like unmanned aerial systems. There is much, much more to say about each of these regions below, both their growing industries and and particularly for tourism ideas, much can be found over at our friends' site, www.traveloregon.com. Nearly year-round, within a 1-3 hour drive, you can enjoy hiking, surfing, rafting and skiing with the appropriate attire, of course.

Industry Initiatives and Strategic Partnerships
Here are some unique partnerships we are involved with to advance particular industries or address industry needs.
Manufacturing
Pacific Northwest Manufacturing Partnership (PNMP), a bi-state consortium of public and private partners, dedicated to accelerating advance manufacturing competitiveness and economic growth. PNMP received a federal IMCP designation that offers preferred access to federal technical expertise and grant funding to benefit Oregon and Southwest Washington advanced manufacturing industries. These industries apply innovative materials and engineering to transform products, or advanced manufacturing processes to retain or strengthen their competitive advantages.  Learn more about PNMP
Oregon Food and Beverage Industry RoadmapBusiness Oregon and other state partners brought together an Oregon Food and Beverage Leadership Steering Committee to produce a Food and Beverage Industry Road Map. The Road Map is intended to support a shared vision among industry leaders, policymakers and economic development professionals across Oregon regarding the opportunity to accelerate growth of the food and beverage industry through collaborative public-private partnerships.
From this work, we now have a complete industry analysis and road map , along with the committee's executive summary  and prioritized recommendations.
Mass Timber
Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) is a sustainable, wood product made of several layers of lumber boards stacked crosswise at 90-degree angles and glued into place to form a massive construction panel. CLT panels can be custom manufactured for applications such as floors, walls, and roofing, including multi-story and high-rise tall building construction. Oregon BEST and Business Oregon partnered with regional stakeholders to evaluate the potential of this advanced manufacturing opportunity in Oregon and Southwest Washington and to catalyze investments that support the rural economies of the region. 2017 Report by Oregon BEST
Transportation
Trade and Logistics InitiativeOregon exporters and importers face increased challenges moving goods to and from global markets with the departure of ocean container service at the Port of Portland. Business Oregon, along with the departments of Agriculture and Transportation, and the Port of Portland, partnered to identify interim shipping options to help Oregon small- and medium-sized businesses stay competitive in the global marketplace. Extensive outreach with hundreds of Oregon businesses produced a series of interim freight logistics solutions, some of which have been adopted by state legislators.

Food & Beverages Industry Roadmap 
Target Industry Groups Frequently Asked Questions & Answers



Food & Beverages
Oregon has a long history in Food and Beverages. It's one of the greatest places to grow a diverse range of agriculture products, and has hundreds of companies doing value-added processing of those products. It's also become an iconic location for craft beer and wine. The Food and Beverage industry as we've defined here does not include Oregon's incredible agriculture products, but only value-added manufactured food and beverage products.
Oregon's fastest-growing manufacturing sector, Food and Beverages, includes brands like Nabisco, Flav-r-Pac, Bob's Red Mill, and ConAgra Foods. The industry now brings in $11 billion in sales from more than 1,200 firms across the state.
One area getting global attention is Oregon's beer and wine. Oregon has hundreds of wineries and craft breweries, and the city of Portland has more breweries than any other city in the world.
Food
This category is essentially all food that is manufactured in some manner in Oregon, but not the commodity products that you'd associate with agriculture. From millions of pounds of tater tots to fine cheese, there are thousands of delicious products being sold throughout the world coming out of Oregon, and they're selling well. This industry has a very strong representation in rural areas as well as urban. For example, ConAgra Foods' operation in Boardman employs 400 and processes around 2 million pounds of potatoes daily. ConAgra employs 4,500 throughout the entire Columbia Basin.
Beverages
Oregon beverages have become a core piece of the state's image and can often be the first manner in which someone is introduced to the state … through Oregon beer, wine or the more recent growth of spirits. With many small wineries having no or few employees, the 381 establishments listed in the employment data can be a little deceiving. The Oregon Wine Board lists 676 wineries in the state. Oregon breweries helped create the modern craft beer movement, and garner international beer awards while producing more than 1 million barrels of beer.

Oregon InC
In 2005, the Governor and Legislature brought together more than 40 leaders from the private sector, the state's four research universities, and government to create a new way to build innovation into the DNA of how Oregon does business. The result was the Oregon Innovation Council (Oregon InC).
Council Programs
Oregon InC is a public-private partnership that helps create new jobs and new companies, diversifying Oregon's economy and bringing federal research dollars back to the state. The council provides funding to accomplish its goals via a series of programs. Those programs are:

Signature Research Centers (SRCs) focus on emerging industry sectors where Oregon has innate advantages and are potential high-growth sectors in the future
High Impact Opportunity Projects (HIOP) are discrete projects that will support the growth of industry sectors by removing barriers, supporting product development/testing, or expediting technology commercialization of other aspects of industry innovation
SBIR Support Program helps small businesses access federal non-dilutive, but very competitive, funding. The program has three types of grants to assist companies: matching grants, phase 0 grants, and phase 00 grants.

Business Oregon Backing Helps "Green" Paint Company Grow Jobs
Since 2002, Business Oregon loans and export assistance has helped Forrest Paint Company of Eugene create nearly 100 jobs over a decade.
READ FULL STORY 



Business Oregon Unable to Provide Financial Services to Marijuana Industry
Despite the passing of Oregon State Ballot Measure 91, Business Oregon is unable to provide financial services to businesses that engage in the possession, manufacture or sale of marijuana for a variety of reasons that include:

Oregon law limits eligibility to participate in most of Business Oregon's programs to traded sector businesses only. ORS 285A.010(17) defines traded sector as "industries in which member firms sell their goods or services into markets for which national or international competition exists." Because marijuana remains illegal in many other states and countries and licensees may not export marijuana from this state, it does not meet the definition of a traded sector business.
Most Business Oregon programs require the applicant to comply with all local, state and federal laws. To date, marijuana is listed as a controlled substance under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (Controlled Substances Act), and thus the possession, manufacture and sale of marijuana remain a crime under federal law.
While legally sanctioned in Oregon, cannabis-related businesses still face significant financial and banking challenges nationwide. To deal with these issues, the Oregon Legislature passed Senate Joint Memorial 12 urging Congress to develop a solution to the financial issues that arise from the operation of a marijuana business and urged Congress to declassify marijuana as a Schedule I drug under the federal Controlled Substances Act. Thus far, neither Congress nor any state legislature has identified a solution to these financial barriers.

Business Oregon is unable to provide loans, loan guarantees, grants, bonds or other financial incentives, or to utilize any portion of its program funds or resources (whether from federal or state sources) to serve companies in the marijuana industry until these legal and financial restrictions are lifted. The above reasons also are generally applicable to tax incentives, whether credits and other types of abatements, that are otherwise available for businesses at the state or local level.
For those looking to do business in the marijuana industry, you may find alternative resources on the National Cannabis Industry Association website.

EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa
The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa, administered by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS), is available to immigrants seeking to enter the United States in order to invest in a new commercial enterprise that will benefit the U.S. economy and create at least 10 full-time jobs. There are two ways to invest in a commercial enterprise within the EB-5 program and they are: creating a new commercial enterprise or investing in a troubled business.
Business Oregon is the designated authority within the state of Oregon to certify geographic areas or political subdivisions that qualify as High Unemployment Areas, which, along with Rural Areas, are recognized as Targeted Employment Areas (TEA) in the EB-5 program. If the enterprise in which the immigrant investor invests in is located in a TEA, the required amount of capital from the immigrant investor to make a qualifying investment is $500,000, otherwise it is $1 million.
What are Targeted Employment Areas?
Targeted Employment Areas are areas that, at the time of investment, are located in a Rural Area or an area that has experienced unemployment of at least 150% of the national average rate, otherwise known as a High Unemployment Area. A Rural Area is any area not within either a Metropolitan Statistical Area (as designated by the Office of Management and Budget) or the outer boundary of any city having a population of 20,000 or more. A High Unemployment Area is a geographic area or political subdivision located within a Metropolitan Statistical Area, or within a city having a population of 20,000 or more, that, at the time of investment, has experienced unemployment of at least 150% of the national average rate.
TEAs in Oregonmaps and listings of counties, cities, Census Designated Places, census tracts, and block groups that currently qualify as TEAs in Oregon.
How do high unemployment areas get designated?
Business Oregon is the agency for the state of Oregon that is authorized to designate High Unemployment Areas. Cities, Census Designated Places, census tracts, and block groups located within Metropolitan Statistical Areas that meet or exceed 150% of the national unemployment rate are automatically designated as High Unemployment Areas. Cities with populations of 20,000 or more located in Rural Areas are not TEAs unless the city, or parts of the city, meet or exceed the 150% national average unemployment rate, in which case, those areas also are designated as High Unemployment Areas.
TEAs in Oregonmaps and listings of counties, cities, Census Designated Places, census tracts, and block groups that currently qualify as TEAs in Oregon.
How can I get my area designated as a high unemployment area?
If the immigrant investor's enterprise is located in an area that meets the qualifications of a High Unemployment Area, Business Oregon can provide a letter that certifies the area as a designated High Unemployment Area. Learn more about the step-by-step process to request a certification letter.
How do I apply for an EB-5 visa?
Application is a 3-step process and is outlined on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services web site. Additionally, these Regional Centers are approved to manage EB-5 investments in Oregon.
Where can I find additional information?

How We Can Help
Business Oregon's approach to traditional business development is anything but traditional. We focus first on supporting the retention and expansion of existing Oregon businesses within traded sectors and foster a dynamic startup and entrepreneurial environment. We then work with companies outside the state to come to Oregon and fill supply chain gaps and grow existing industry clusters.
Our business and community development team focuses on proactive and substantive partnerships with the private sector, in partnership with local and regional economic development organizations. This team serves as the front door to a suite of services to identify opportunities and address challenges related to business growth and community development.
Access to Capital
In addition to ideas, workers and strong management, innovation-driven companies, like all others, need money. We offer direct loan and loan guarantee programs to help business grow and scale, as well as working capital. Learn more about access to capital >>
Global Trade
Oregon is a global competitor in everything from high tech to agriculture and natural resources. Approximately 95% of the world's consumers live outside of the U.S. We help Oregon companies reach those customers and bring new revenue into the state, as well as work to attract foreign direct investment. The Global Trade team pairs expertise with both foreign market and industry, along with small matching grants to get Oregon's small businesses into foreign markets. Learn more about global trade >>
Infrastructure
Business Oregon manages the state's infrastructure needs and prioritizes them in order to ensure the best use of the state's limited resources. We provide financing to municipalities for extending and upgrading physical infrastructure, as well as catalyzing job creation opportunities when paired with business development projects. Funding focuses on these areas: infrastructure capacity; community health and safety; business development opportunities; and industrial land availability. Learn more about infrastructure >>
Innovation/Entrepreneurship
Sometimes the precursor to business development and trade is innovation that leads to new ideas, that lead to new products or applications, that lead to new businesses and new markets. Business Oregon works to facilitate an entrepreneurial-friendly environment and drives innovation across a variety of industries and business stages. We also house the Oregon InC and corresponding Oregon Innovation Plan to stand up signature research centers that provide shared lab space, high-tech extension services and more. Learn more about innovation >>
Talent and Workforce
Oregon has a strong workforce particularly in areas such as high tech manufacturing, software and other advanced manufacturing industries. We also partner with other agencies to support continued development of an equipped workforce.

Business Oregon Backing Helps "Green" Paint Company Grow Jobs
Since 2002, Business Oregon loans and export assistance has helped Forrest Paint Company of Eugene create nearly 100 jobs over a decade.
READ FULL STORY 




Innovate & Create
The creation and adoption of new products, services and business models is a fundamental driver of economic prosperity. The young companies, universities and institutions behind those new products expand markets and sales, stimulating investment and ultimately creating jobs. 
Council & Board
To compete, Oregon must prioritize investment in research and development, technology commercialization, new product development, and entrepreneurship in urban and rural communities and with full participation by underrepresented populations. Quality job growth depends on a thriving startup ecosystem where research and development can transition into commercialized technology and job-creating companies.
Oregon InC
The Oregon Innovation Council (Oregon InC) was created to help entrepreneurs turn cutting-edge research into new companies. Its initiatives help open the door to hard-to-find capital; provide Oregon businesses with access to otherwise out-of-reach R&D; labs and researchers; and show established industries how innovation can revitalize their products and their profits. 
Oregon Growth Board
The Oregon Growth Board was created in the 2012 Legislative Session in an effort to spur more economic growth in Oregon. An important focus is placed on leveraging state resources improie the availablility of capital for Oregon-based high-growth companies. The board manages two sources of investment capital.

Vocal Booth
City: Bend, OR County: Deschutes Senate District: 27 House District: 54




Bend's VocalBooth Provides the Perfect Sound for the Stars



 Thanks to a Business Oregon-backed line of credit, a Bend musician's company manufacturing state-of-the-art sound recording booths for some of the world's top recording artists was able to grow and add new workers.
Business Oregon's assistance helped the company grow its workforce 30% to 15 employees since 2012. In 2012, the company was able to lease a 16,000-square-foot building near VocalBooth's main facility in Bend to provide more production space for working with sheet metal. Company founder Calvin Mann also told the Bend Bulletin that VocalBooth is trying to be more environmentally friendly, recently switching to recycled wood scraps and glue with less toxicity.
Business Oregon's $150,000 loan guarantee to the company, in conjunction with Columbia Bank, was funded with State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) funds from the U.S. Treasury. Business Oregon received $16.5 million in SSBCI funds in 2011. The funds are disbursed through Business Oregon's existing finance tools.
The company began in 1997 when Mann, a Bend singer and songwriter, began working on a sound studio in his garage. VocalBooth manufactures state-of-the-art portable vocal booths and sound isolation enclosures for the professional as well as the home recording studio enthusiasts at its 11,000-square-foot manufacturing facility. Sixteen years later, VocalBooth has built thousands of audio booths for companies including Intel, Microsoft and Dolby, as well as performers such as Lady Gaga and Mariah Carey.
The booths, which start at $4,000, come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from simple, square, 4-by-4-feet booths to diamond-shaped booths roughly 5 by 7 feet. The most common applications for the company's booths include recording, voice over, broadcast, studio control, audio post-production, drum isolation, rehearsal and meeting rooms. The company's products also are used in audiology for scientific testing and industrial sound dampening industries worldwide.

Oregon Food Processing
For well over 100 years, cargo ships have traveled from Oregon ports, carrying a bounty of agricultural exports, grown or processed here in the Northwest.
Oregon's renowned retail food products have helped put the state on the map, like Rogue Creamery's famous Oregon Blue cheese, which beat out its global rivals at the London World Cheese Awards, the first time an American cheese has ever won. And certainly not to be forgotten are Oregon's excellent wine and craft beer producers. Oregon is home to 120 brewing companies and 450 wineries, many of which export their products to connoisseurs worldwide.
Innovation is driving Oregon's food industry. State-sponsored research is making food processors more productive while cutting energy consumption by 25% in the next 10 years. New products are being developed by university researchers to keep Oregon's famous seafood fresher and more nutritious.
Team Oregon
TEAM Oregon is a coalition of Business Oregon and multiple local/regional economic development organizations in the state. The group markets Oregon's advantages as a location for food processing.
The team's mission is to identify growing and expanding food processors, develop relationships and generate business recruitment leads. At the same time, we are supporting our existing food producers by developing stronger resources and valuable information about their industry.
The team is collecting industry data and valuable resources designed to help recruit, retain and expand the multi-million dollar food processing industry in Oregon. Strategically positioned to support the food processing industry in our local communities, together, we send a strong message to out-of-state companies that Oregon is open for business and that we will welcome their business to expand into our state.
See team members and discover how you can join the team.

Enterprise Zones
Oregon's enterprise zones offer a unique resource to Oregon communities, and an excellent opportunity for businesses growing or locating in Oregon. Primarily, enterprise zones exempt businesses from local property taxes on new investments for a specified amount of time, which varies among the different zone programs.
Sponsored by city, port, county, or tribal governments, an enterprise zone typically serves as a focal point for local development efforts. There are currently 73 enterprise zones creating better opportunities for business investment across Oregon: 56 rural and 17 urban. Local governments are responsible for creating, amending, managing, and renewing most of these zones, until June 30, 2025.
Learn more about zone sponsorship >>
Standard Program
In exchange for locating or expanding into any enterprise zone, eligible (generally non-retail) businesses receive total exemption from the property taxes normally assessed on new plant and equipment. Subject to local authorization, timely filings and criteria the benefits include:

Construction-in-Process Enterprise Zone ExemptionFor up to two years before qualified property is placed in service, it can be exempt from local taxes, which can cover more property than the regular exemption for commercial facilities under construction.
Three to five consecutive years of full relief from property taxes on qualified property, after it is in service.
Depending on the zone, local incentives also may be available.

Learn more about eligibility >>
Special Programs
In addition, some enterprise zones offer special business tax incentives.

Long-term Rural Enterprise Zone Facilities
Available in most rural designations, the long-term program extends property tax abatement to as many as 15 years on new facility improvements and installations. Any type of business activity is eligible, but these incentives depend on local approval and varying levels of minimum investment, job creation and employee compensation at the facility, depending on location. 
Learn more about Long-term Rural >>
Electronic Commerce Zones
Several enterprise zones have received special status to further encourage electronic commerce, or "e-commerce," investments. Learn more about Electronic Commerce >>
Tribal Zones
Federally-recognized Tribes in Oregon may have any of the Tribe's land designated as a "reservation enterprise zone." The Tribal government is the zone "sponsor." A Tribe also may create a special "partnership" zone through an agreement with a local government. Both designation types include a state income tax credit for any type of business to offset the Tribal taxes that it might pay. Learn more about Tribal Zones >>

Innovate & Create
The creation and adoption of new products, services and business models is a fundamental driver of economic prosperity. The young companies, universities and institutions behind those new products expand markets and sales, stimulating investment and ultimately creating jobs. 
Council & Board
To compete, Oregon must prioritize investment in research and development, technology commercialization, new product development, and entrepreneurship in urban and rural communities and with full participation by underrepresented populations. Quality job growth depends on a thriving startup ecosystem where research and development can transition into commercialized technology and job-creating companies.
Oregon InC
The Oregon Innovation Council (Oregon InC) was created to help entrepreneurs turn cutting-edge research into new companies. Its initiatives help open the door to hard-to-find capital; provide Oregon businesses with access to otherwise out-of-reach R&D; labs and researchers; and show established industries how innovation can revitalize their products and their profits. 
Oregon Growth Board
The Oregon Growth Board was created in the 2012 Legislative Session in an effort to spur more economic growth in Oregon. An important focus is placed on leveraging state resources improie the availablility of capital for Oregon-based high-growth companies. The board manages two sources of investment capital.

Orox Leather
City: Portland, OR County: Multnomah Senate District: 18 House District: 36




A Little of the Old, A Little of the New Equals Success for Orox Leather Company



 Tapping into the "old" magic that comes from handmade leather, all the while producing decidedly 21st century products for modern consumers, helps Portland's Orox Leather Company thrive.
The company, a fourth-generation, family-run leatherworking business founded in 1933, opened a new headquarters and retail space in August 2013 in Portland's Pearl District. Business Oregon provided technical expertise and export assistance to the company through World Trade Week and helped it find customers for its products earlier this year at a Las Vegas trade show with a $3,340 Oregon Trade Promotion Program grant.
Orox produces such items as durable bike panniers, briefcases and artisan tote bags at its leather workshop in Portland. While seeking customers across the nation, the company also has benefited from the "buy local" mentality of many Oregonians. But as co-owner Martin Martinez found out at the February 2013 Capsule trade show in Las Vegas, "Made in Portland's" cachet stretches nationwide.
Or as he told Alaska Airlines/Horizon Air magazine in October 2013, "It's got its own cachet now, 'Made in Portland,'" says Martinez, one of the five family members involved in Orox Leather Co. "We have international customers from places like Japan and Canada who want to be sure they are buying something made right here."

Expansion of Cold Storage Facilities Results in 35 New Jobs
NORPAC and Henningsen Cold Storage will collaborate on a major expansion of food processing facilities in Salem.
READ FULL STORY 



Business Oregon Unable to Provide Financial Services to Marijuana Industry
Despite the passing of Oregon State Ballot Measure 91, Business Oregon is unable to provide financial services to businesses that engage in the possession, manufacture or sale of marijuana for a variety of reasons that include:

Oregon law limits eligibility to participate in most of Business Oregon's programs to traded sector businesses only. ORS 285A.010(17) defines traded sector as "industries in which member firms sell their goods or services into markets for which national or international competition exists." Because marijuana remains illegal in many other states and countries and licensees may not export marijuana from this state, it does not meet the definition of a traded sector business.
Most Business Oregon programs require the applicant to comply with all local, state and federal laws. To date, marijuana is listed as a controlled substance under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (Controlled Substances Act), and thus the possession, manufacture and sale of marijuana remain a crime under federal law.
While legally sanctioned in Oregon, cannabis-related businesses still face significant financial and banking challenges nationwide. To deal with these issues, the Oregon Legislature passed Senate Joint Memorial 12 urging Congress to develop a solution to the financial issues that arise from the operation of a marijuana business and urged Congress to declassify marijuana as a Schedule I drug under the federal Controlled Substances Act. Thus far, neither Congress nor any state legislature has identified a solution to these financial barriers.

Business Oregon is unable to provide loans, loan guarantees, grants, bonds or other financial incentives, or to utilize any portion of its program funds or resources (whether from federal or state sources) to serve companies in the marijuana industry until these legal and financial restrictions are lifted. The above reasons also are generally applicable to tax incentives, whether credits and other types of abatements, that are otherwise available for businesses at the state or local level.
For those looking to do business in the marijuana industry, you may find alternative resources on the National Cannabis Industry Association website.

Business Expansion Program
This incentive program is available to existing companies expanding operations in Oregon or new companies coming into the state. The Oregon Business Expansion Program (BEP) is a cash-based incentive (forgivable loan) equivalent to the estimated increase in income tax revenue from the new hiring.
Eligibility

Company plans to hire 50 or more full-time (equivalent) employees in Oregon and already has at least 150 employees
Annual pay for each of at least the 50 new employees will equal or exceed:
	150% of the state or county average wage, whichever is less, or
130% of the state or county average wage, whichever is less, if hired to work in a county outside any federally-designated metropolitan statistical area (MSA)
Retailers are specifically excluded and the company must otherwise sell goods or services into markets involving national or international competition—'traded sector'which can include corporate headquarters as well as manufacturing

Program Administration

Business submits information to Business Oregon, which awards funds pursuant to a binding agreement
Business must declare that availability of program funds is an integral factor in its decision to hire at least the 50 new employees at the above pay scale
Agreement contains detailed performance measures, including that:

Company repays funds proportional with its failing to meet and maintain employment and compensation targets over at least two years
Hiring results in additional payroll in Oregon that is not, for example, offset by layoffs elsewhere
Company commits to consult with Oregon vendors before contracting to purchase goods or services



Program Mechanics

Program is capitalized with state Lottery Funds
Award is based on two years (at full operation) of estimated incremental personal income taxes that the state would collect from new employees at the above pay scale

Oregon Investment Advantage
With an up-to-10-year income tax holiday, this program helps businesses start or locate new operations in many Oregon counties.
Companies setting up operations in an eligible county can be certified as many as 10 consecutive times to annually deduct or subtract taxable income related to those operations, potentially eliminating any state business income tax liability for that period.
Requirements of the certified facility include:

creation of at least five new full-time, year-round jobs that
	each have a minimum level of compensation, and
receive wages averaging 100% or more of the current county wage;

facility operations are the first of their kind anywhere in Oregon for that company (which often is an existing Oregon business); and
they do not compete with local existing businesses.

Having five or more facility employees receiving sufficient compensation and average wage are requirements to be satisfied with each application for annual certification. The uniqueness of operations to the company and other requirements generally pertain only as of the date that the application for preliminary certification is submitted to Business Oregon, which is also when the county's per capita income level is set for purposes of minimum compensation that includes elective fringe/financial benefits in addtion to wages and other taxable income.
The application for preliminary certification is due before any hiring or work commences on the facility, and the process for approval involves a 60-day period, during which local governments could potentially object. Applications for annual certification need to be received by Business Oregon within 30 days after any of 10 consecutive income tax yearsonce the facility's new operations have been up and running for at least 24 months as of the date of the first such application.

Renewable Energy
Renewable Energy and Related Incentives
Rural Renewable Energy Development ZonesA three- to five-year exemption from property taxes on new investments in solar energy farms, geothermal power generation, biofuel production facilities and other eligible projects in a designated county.
Fee in Lieu of Property Taxes Pursuant to executing an agreement with the county (and city, if inside one), any solar project may be exempt for up to 20 years, contingent on annual payment to the county/city of a fee equal to $7,000 per megawatt of the project's nameplate capacity, and provided that the project is or was not subject to any other exemption.
State Energy Loan Program (SELP)for renewable energy, including manufacturing facilities. Loans range from 5 to 20 years and $20,000 to $20 million, depending on the borrower's need and financial situation. The Oregon Department of Energy finances these low-interest loans with authority to issue state general obligation bonds.
Alternative Energy Systems (ORS 307.175)This abatement exempts the additional taxable value of equipping a property with net metering or with alternative systems for onsite electricity or climate control as compared to a conventional system until 2023.
Renewable Energy Policies
Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)Oregon has one of the most aggressive renewable energy policies in the nation. This standard requires that electric utilities must meet at least 25% of their Oregon load with renewable energy by the year 2025. Virtually all of Oregon's electric load growth will therefore come mainly from new renewable energy. The standard also provides a goal that at least 1/3 of these targets be met by resources smaller than 25 megawatts in size. Solar energy counts double towards meeting the targets, and by 2020, investor-owned utilities need to also have at least 20 megawatts in total capacity from solar photovoltaic projects between 0.5 and 5 megawatts in size. 
Feed-in TariffIn 2009, Oregon enacted one of the first Feed-in Tariffs in the U.S. for photovoltaic systems. The law establishes a pilot feed-in tariff for each investor-owned utility in the state. Under this pilot program, each qualifying system may be up to 0.5 megawatts in size, with a maximum of 27.5 megawatts in total statewide capacity.
Energy Trust of OregonWith more than 17 years of experience, the nonprofit Energy Trust of Oregon provides information, technical assistance and up to $500,000 per project in cash incentives to help commercial, industrial and agricultural businesses around the state maximize energy savings and produce renewable energy.

Target Industry Groups Frequently Asked Questions & Answers



Outdoor Gear & Apparel
Home to Nike, Adidas America, and Columbia Sportswear, Outdoor Gear and Apparel is one of the iconic industries of Oregon. The industry has blossomed from these large global brands, with new ideas, new opportunities, and new companies sprouting from the large pool of industry talent that has amassed in Oregon. Growing, mid-sized companies like Keen, Dakine, Ruff Wear, and LaCrosse/Danner have benefited from the extensive design and logistics expertise found in the region.
Oregon's proximity to the Pacific Rim lets these companies interact with counterparts in Asia and Europe, as well as exchange materials and finished goods.
Apparel & Footwear
Oregon's storied history with Apparel and Footwear began with the birth of Nike, now a global icon with it's headquarters in Oregon and well over 8,000 employed in the state. Pair that with the presence of adidas' North American headquarters and 272 additional establishments, this sector is not only a unique competitive advantage for the state, but also is a core part of the state's lifestyle and image.
Outdoor Gear
With a sweeping coastline, snow-capped mountain ranges, rocky high deserts, and countless lakes, rivers, and streams, Oregon is a place where outdoor gear gets pushed to its limits. And companies want to do business in the places their gear can be put to use. From the world-renowned kiteboarding and windsurfing in the Columbia Gorge to the slopes of Mt. Hood, the outdoor-oriented culture in Oregon draws young creative entrepreneurs who come to the state to not only enjoy the bounty of its geography, but to make a living by creating a better multi-tool to have at the ready, or a better bike to descend a mountain.
With a balance of manufacturing prowess, innovative designers, and an outdoor-focused culture, Oregon has proven to be the ideal location for gear manufacturers like Leatherman Tools, Benchmade Knives, Dakine, and Yakima.

Growing in Oregon















Oregon Business
Oregonians like to think things look different in their state, with a breathtaking public coastline, majestic mountain peaks and world class breweries. The same goes for Oregon's economy with a diverse manufacturing base and significant growth in high-tech hardware, software development, food processing and outdoor gear. In other words, we still make things here in Oregon. And far more than double lattes and pale ales.
Oregonians manufacture silicon chips with a vibrant high-tech industry anchored by Intel's largest facility in the world. Oregon is a leader in food processing with literally tons of local berries, hazelnuts and wheat turned into countless products by ConAgra, Amy's Kitchen, Diamond Foods and hundreds of other food processing firms and shipped all across the globe. A fast-growing aerospace and Unmanned Aerial Systems industry also is rising up, with leaders such as Precision Castparts, Boeing and Cloudcap Technologies leading the way.
But while we are confident our business cost structures are very competitive, we tend to find that such assets as Pacific Rim access, quality workforce and enviable quality of life often make the difference. While costs are competitive, it's quality that wins in the end.
It may be a data center that needs dependable, affordable power in a low-humidity environment with a property tax abatement and attraction of no sales tax for the tens of millions of dollars' worth of equipment they plan to purchase. That was what helped seal the deal for Facebook's first company-built data centers now located in Central Oregon as well as Google, Amazon and Apple, all of which have major data centers here in Oregon.
It might be an outdoor gear firm that wants to attract designers to a diverse urban environment with access to the beach, the mountains and the high desert within a couple hours' drive. That is why such firms as Keen, Dakine, Ruffwear and LaCrosse-Danner call Oregon home.
Or cutting-edge software firms like Salesforce.com, ebay, Urban Airship, Jama and Aruba Networks expanding in Portland due to a critical mass of talented programmers, designers and suppliers paired with a compelling quality of life delivered at a much lower cost than competing metro locations outside Oregon.

Department Rulemaking
Administrative Rules
Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) are adopted to carry out laws. Rules may be necessary because a law directs an agency to develop rules, to interpret the agency's governing statutes, prescribe agency procedures or articulate agency policy decisions that have been delegated by the legislature.
The Archives Division of the Secretary of State maintains the official record for rulemaking by all state agencies. Current administrative rules relating to the department can be found on the Secretary of State Web site, Administrative Rules. The Oregon Arts Commission administrative rules are found in OAR Chapter 190.
The Secretary of State publishes the notice of information for proposed rules in the Oregon Bulletin, however the Secretary of State does not publish the draft rule text. Draft rule text of rules relating to the department are made available in PDF format.
The public can send comments on proposed rules found here by U.S. mail, fax or email. If a public hearing is scheduled, individuals may provide comments orally or in writing at the hearing. Once the rules have been approved and filed with the Secretary of State, the draft rules will be removed.
Public Participation
Any person may comment on rules in writing. Comments can be sent to the Business Oregon Rules Coordinator by mail, fax or email. There is no required format for submitting comments, however, please include the rule number or rule topic.

Cosmos Creations
City: Junction City, OR County: Lane Senate District: 7 House District: 14




Junction City Caramel Corn Maker Plans to Add 150 New Jobs



 In less than a decade, Cosmos Creations, a Junction City caramel corn maker, went from a local favorite to a fast growing employer in this small Willamette Valley community. Then, in mid-2014, it announced plans to more than triple its workforce from 55 employees to more than 200 as it expands into a new, $14 million manufacturing facility by then end of 2014.
The latest expansion plans came after Business Oregon backed the food processing company with four different loans or loan guarantees over a two-year period. Just prior to the company's announcement of its latest expansion plans, in June 2014, Business Oregon provided the company a loan guarantee on a working capital loan through the Credit Enhancement Fund (CEF).
In addition, in late 2013, Business Oregon provided the company an loan for equipment from the Oregon Business Development Fund (OBDF) in conjunction with a guarantee on a working capital loan to the company through CEF. The financial backing from the state was expected to help the company more than double its workforce from 37 full-time employees to an estimated 80 within three years.
In January 2012, Business Oregon also backed the company with a CEF loan guarantee. In total, Business Oregon has provided loans or loan guarantee worth a total of more than $1.5 million.
Cosmos Creations started as Cosmos Caramel Corn in 2004 in the small kitchen of a culinary artist. After it became a local sensation, the company expanded from the kitchen to a 5,000-square-foot facility that produced more than a dozen varieties of the unique caramel treat. Cosmos gained distribution across the state of Oregon and eventually developed a loyal following by attending many home shows and other events, and providing samples to attendees.
Cosmos produces and sells a gourmet, oven-baked corn that has no husks, shells or kernels. It is gluten free, trans-fat free and preservative free. The company makes a wide variety of flavors and sizes that are sold in its retail store and on-line.
Business Oregon's OBDF loan to the company was funded with State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) funds from the U.S. Treasury. Business Oregon received $16.5 million in SSBCI funds in 2011. The funds are disbursed through Business Oregon's existing finance tools.
In July 2011, Cosmos was purchased by John Strasheim and DeWayne Tiller, operating as the 4 Him Food Group. Tiller was introduced to Cosmos in 2006 at a trade show in Las Vegas. At the time, Tiller did not even realize the company was located only five miles from his own home in Oregon.

Target Industry Groups Frequently Asked Questions & Answers



Business Services
People often think of manufacturing when they hear the term traded sector, but there's more to Oregon's traded sector than manufacturing. In today's connected world, service providers are competing more and more in national and international markets. Traded sector industries within business services include Professional and Technical Services, Company Management, and Customer Support. Oregon is an emerging, competitive market for Professional and Technical Services, such as consulting, advertising and public relations, architectural services, graphic design, and market research
Business Services is Oregon's fastest growing Target Industry Group, with 32% employment growth over the past 10 years. Wages also have grown much faster in Business Services than other Target Industry Groups. Talented, innovative workers are moving to Oregon in big numbers and many of these workers are joining and starting, fast-growing business service companies. Oregon's combination of workforce talent, outdoor and cultural amenities, and comparatively low cost of doing business have created the perfect environment for business service companies to grow and prosper.
Professional & Technical Services
Professional and Technical Services is a fast-growing, emerging industry in Oregon made up of innovative businesses and workers who are using their expertise and creativity to help businesses around the U.S., and world, grow. Management and technical consulting is the largest industry in this group, followed by engineering services and advertising, public relations, and related services. Consulting and engineering includes a number of companies who specialize in clean technology. CH2M, for example, is an employee-owned global engineering company that was founded in Corvallis and now has more than 26,000 employees worldwide. With locations in Portland, Corvallis, and Bend, CH2M Hill specializes in management of large infrastructure projects around the world, with a focus on sustainability.
Some of the best and brightest minds in advertising and public relations can be found in Oregon. Wieden+Kennedy, one of the largest independently-owned advertising agencies in the world, is based here. This industry depends on talent and throughout the Professional and Technical Services sector, workers are drawn to Oregon for its high quality of life and innovative companies.
Company Management
Oregon isn't known as a home for Fortune 500 companies (Nike being our biggest and most well-known), but we do have a competitive advantage in the Company Management industry. Company Management includes corporate and regional offices whose staff are normally tasked with strategic or organizational planning and decision-making for the company. Companies with company management operations here include Daimler Trucks, Wells Fargo, and clean technology companies Vestas and Iberdrola.
Many companies have management offices in Oregon and their numbers are growing. Companies choose to expand their offices in Oregon because their workers love it here, and companies love it too because the cost of doing business in Oregon is lower than most other states and the cost of living here is the lowest on the West Coast.
Customer Support
Oregon's competitive advantage in Customer Support comes primarily from its well-established call center industry. Call centers are found throughout Oregon, including many rural areas of the state. These jobs are an important source of income in rural communities. Other industries in Customer Support include travel arrangement services and convention and trade show organizers. These industries are smaller than the call center industry, but are growing much faster and gaining market share in the U.S. They also tend to pay a higher wage than call centers. Like the rest of Business Services, companies in Customer Support are drawn to Oregon for its quality workforce and low cost of doing business.

At the same time, we support our existing manufacturers by connecting them to opportunities, developing stronger resources and collecting valuable information about their industry. We also recruit companies to fill strategic missing links in the supply chain and attract buyers and suppliers to support Oregon companies
The team is collecting industry data and valuable resources designed to help recruit, retain and expand  manufacturing in Oregon. by pooling resources and combining efforts to promote manufacturing industry in our local communities, together, we send a strong message to out-of-state companies that Oregon is open for business and offers many competitive advantages to support their success.

Oregon's Tax Structure 



Oregon's Tax Structure
Oregon has no tax on general sales and use, business purchases, inventory, intangible property or capital stock.
General Business
General business information from Oregon Department of Revenue.
Corporate Income TaxSingle Sales Factor
The tax rate on corporate income of firms doing business in the state is the greater of a minimum tax based on relative Oregon sales ($150$100,000, approximating 0.1% of sales by entity) or an income-based levy of 6.6% on taxable income up to $1 million and 7.6% above that.

Relative Oregon sales are responsible 100% in determining U.S. corporate income taxable in Oregon. This single interstate factor stands in contrast to states that still also use factors for property and payroll to apportion taxable income. It is advantageous to a business headquartered or producing goods or services in Oregon but selling them throughout the country, or the world, where it also operates, because its business tax liability is proportional only to its Oregon customer base, and that liability does not grow directly as a result of greater investment or employment in Oregon.
How the single sales factor works:
In its Oregon tax return, the business takes the ratio of Oregon sales to total U.S. sales and applies that ratio to its consolidated federal income. The result is Oregon taxable income. Included are the throwback of sales of tangible goods originating in Oregon that are made to the U.S. Government or to customers where the particular corporate entity would not otherwise be taxable, i.e., has no nexus. Intangible sales are assigned according to a market-based approach and similarly treated, except that extra-nexus sales are thrown out rather than thrown back.
Corporate tax information and forms from Oregon Department of Revenue.
Personal Income Tax
Personal income tax rates (2019) start at 5%, rising to 7% on single/joint tax returns with taxable income greater than $3,550/$7,100, and then 9% on income greater than $8,900/$17,800, up to $125,000/$250,000. At that point, the marginal rate is 9.9% on income in excess of that level. The same rate applies to capital gains as other personal income. Lower rates can apply to the nonpassive income of certain pass-through businesses, for which Oregon is disconnected from the 20% deduction of qualified business income under federal law.
Personal income tax and payroll-withholding information from Oregon Department of Revenue.
Property Tax
Except for voter-approved bond issuances to cover capital costs, property taxes are constitutionally limited to not more than 1.5 percent of real market value among the several levies for only local government, schools and other service districts at a given location. The increase in valuation of property for tax purposes is limited to 3 percent per year. 
Tax abatement programs like the Enterprise Zone and Strategic Investment programs are often available to reduce or largely eliminate property tax liability for a certain number of years.

Face Rock Creamery
City: Bandon, OR County: Coos Senate District: 1 House District: 1




Artisan Cheese Making Returns to Bandon



 Situated on the former site of the Bandon Cheese Factory and employing one of its former cheese makers, Face Rock Creamery has tapped deep into this south coast community's heralded history of producing curds and whey. The Face Rock Creamery stands in the heart of Bandon's historic industrial Woolen Mill District, on land claimed by the city especially for cheese production. Bandon has been home to cheese making since the 1880s.
The new artisan creamery will produce its own handmade cheeses, curds and butter, and will retail its manufactured dairy products along with ice cream, wine, deli items and gifts. The operation expects to create 10 jobs initially and as many as 16 in three years.
Creamery Owner Greg Drobot is originally from the Seattle area, but fell in love with Bandon during a visit in 2005 and vowed to return one day. After meeting the former cheese factory's owner, Greg decided to make the dream of bringing a creamery back to Bandon a reality.
"I fell in love with the area," Drobot told The World of Coos Bay. "I think it was a dream in the rough and I knew the old cheese factory was very successful."
The $2.2 million, 8,000-square-foot manufacturing and retail facility was built with the help of a $256,000 Oregon Business Development Fund (OBDF) loan. Other financial partners included the non-profit community development financial institution Craft3, the Port of Bandon Economic Development Fund, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development and the Coos Curry Douglas Development Corp.
The Port of Bandon Economic Development Fund, one of 14 intermediary lenders in Oregon, received a $1 million Intermediary Relending Program (IRP) loan from USDA Rural Development in 1995 and a $500,000 IRP loan in 2000. For this project, they lent $250,000 to Face Rock Creamery as part of a financing package for construction, the purchase of equipment and working capital. With funding sources lined up for the project, the city of Bandon then agreed to develop the property and serve as the landlord.
The new cheese factory will feature: an 18-foot "cheese trough" of samples, 12 varieties of cheeses initially along with other specialty cheeses made by other Oregon producers, and high-end cultured butter made from the whey generated during cheese making. In addition, Face Rock will serve at least 10 flavors of Umpqua Ice Cream in 7-ounce scoops.
The milk for the cheese will come exclusively from the Scolari Dairy in the nearby Coquille Valley. The dairy currently has 180 Holstein and Brown Swiss cows but has the capacity to increase that to 460 cows.

Business Climate
Place matters. Talented people with unique skills and innovative ideas want to carry out their business vision in a place that provides an economic ecosystem that supports strong growth. But, they want to do so in a great place to live. 
In Oregon, we don't need to manufacture our own attractions. We have a breathtaking public coastline. Striking mountain peaks. River gorges. Lush forests. High desert. These are core assets that also provided for the birth of Oregon's economy through natural-resource based industries.
Today our economy is as diverse as our landscape. Our state economy is a collection of unique regional economies. Semiconductors, manufacturing, wood products, aviation, food products.
Right now across Oregon those diverse regional economies are driving record employment levels along with the second-best Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and personal income growth in the country. Oregon's location along the Pacific Rim provides easy access to foreign markets, particularly between the U.S. and Asia. Portland International Airport has been ranked #1 U.S. airport by Travel + Leisure for four years in a row.

Industry Strength
Oregon has a diverse manufacturing base with an emerging high-wage creative sector. Anchored by the strong high-tech presence, Oregon's innovation culture is impressive. Oregon ranks 6th in patents per worker and 9th in business R&D; spending.
Currently experiencing a tech boom, both hardware and software sectors are growing strongly. The software industry is 2.5 times more concentrated in Oregon than other states.
While many diverse industries are thriving in Oregon, Business Oregon identified these top growing industries within the state where we focus programs. These are separate from areas like agriculture and tourism that are addressed by different agencies.
Competitive Costs
Low Business Taxes
Oregon has the lowest effective tax rate of all states for FY2014, at 3.3%. Our business tax rate has been ranked in the top five lowest effective tax rates for the past five years by Ernst & Young. Oregon has no sales tax, and corporations that operate in Oregon, but sell goods in other states, pay corporate income taxes based solely on company sales within the state of Oregon.

Oregon offers globally competitive incentives, like property tax abatements, income tax credits, and others that encourage business expansion. Learn more about Oregon incentives >>
West Coast Low Cost Leader
Due to Oregon's ability to harness hydropower, Oregon's energy costs are among the lowest industrial rates in the U.S., averaging less than six cents per kilowatt hour (kWh). Oregon's average industrial electricity rates are half those of California, with a more stable supply.




Oregon is a national leader in usage and promotion of renewables for businesses and consumers.

Despite housing boom, Oregon is still the far cheaper cost of living option compared to California and Washington.
Business Oregon
We celebrate all that growth and success, but also recognize there's a continued need to create opportunities for prosperity for all Oregon communities, particularly rural areas of the state, and we will use the talent and programs we have available to do just that.
Business Oregon's role is to assist in the retention and expansion of existing Oregon businesses within traded sectors (industry sectors with global competition). We carry out strategies to create a dynamic startup and entrepreneurial environment so new business can form. And we will recruit companies outside the state as well, to come to Oregon and fill supply chain gaps and grow existing industry clusters.
Business Oregon also manages infrastructure finance programs through its infrastructure division, with a separate Infrastructure Finance Authority Board that oversees these infrastructure investments. These programs are available to local municipalities for water systems, wastewater systems, port development, some roads, and other infrastructure needs that serve as either a precursor for business development or meet other community needs.
