                                            Quality of Life                                    













THE TENNESSEE LIFESTYLE.
In Tennessee, we think the quality of life should be high and the cost of living should be low. No other state offers the lifestyle Tennessee provides.


Make your life where you make your living. Whether it’s the sophistication of our big cities or the southern charm of our small towns, our state offers a cost of living well below the national average.
From the foothills of the beautiful Smoky Mountains to the broad banks of the Mississippi, the Volunteer State spans three distinct regions, each with its own personality. You’ll have plenty of room to stretch your legs and plant your roots.
Tennessee boasts some of the lowest housing prices in the United States, and your dollar will stretch further here than almost anywhere else in the country.
And there’s plenty here to amuse and entertain you, from our legendary music and arts to our stunning scenery to the endless options for outdoor recreation.
Tennessee’s music and arts pedigree is unlike any other. After all, our state is the birthplace of rock ‘n’ roll and country music, the home of the blues and the starting point of soul. Music is only the beginning. Tennessee is the new hub of creative innovation, technology and performing arts—a playground for big names and even bigger ideas. Our state is where classic meets cutting edge.
Tennessee is legendary for breathtaking landscapes, from lush forests and crystal-clear rivers to rolling hills and awe-inspiring mountain vistas. People come from all over the world to take advantage of our state’s abundant resources for fishing, hiking, boating, hunting, golfing, cycling, horseback riding, rock climbing and more.
Since we appreciate the value of loyalty and the thrill of the game, allegiance to our favorite sports teams runs deep. Tennesseans show their colors at stadiums, racetracks, arenas and ballparks across the state. There’s no shortage of professional and collegiate teams to cheer on.

COMMUNITY AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT

We know that economic development doesn’t start with board meetings and blueprints—it starts with thoughtful community development. Tennessee continually invests in programs to ensure that our communities are among the best places in the world to live and work. We support rural communities to the resources they need, and see our towns and cities through downtown revitalization and management efforts.
Our community and rural development programs include:
ThreeStar is designed to strengthen economic development, ensure responsible fiscal management, and assist with public safety, health and education efforts at a local level.
Select Tennessee helps communities prepare sites for investment and job creation, offering reduced risk and shortened timelines for development.
Tennessee Main Street and its affiliated Tennessee Downtowns program help communities with downtown revitalization and management strategies based on the National Main Street Center model.
National Flood Insurance Program provides technical assistance and coordination activities for sound floodplain management.
Tennessee’s vibrant cities and towns provide a quality of life that is second to none, so you can live and work in a place you’ll be proud to call home.

Long-term growth meets increased profitability with competitive grants for workforce training, public infrastructure and economic development. Our commitment doesn’t stop there. We offer incentives to help make your decision an easy one.

                                            Advanced Materials                                    













A legacy of excellence
Innovation. Location. Skill. Tennessee has all the tools you need for success in the advanced materials industry.



There’s a long history of manufacturers, both domestic and foreign, migrating to Tennessee for advanced materials production. We welcome you to join the legacy.
With our geographical advantage and access to natural resources, advanced material manufacturers in Tennessee have distinguished themselves from regional and national competitors in glass, rubber and ceramics industries. These manufacturers employ 16,800+ Tennesseans, ranking us 3rd in the nation for employment in the advanced materials industry. Combine location with our skilled and stable workforce and you’ll have a competitive advantage in Tennessee.
The automotive industry and advanced materials go hand-in-hand in Tennessee. The continued influx of automotive investment into our state bolsters glass and rubber production, generating substantial revenue. Major automotive manufacturing companies like Bridgestone and Hankook Tires are headquartered in Nashville and employ nearly 4,000 workers with the skills to manufacture over 5,800 tires per day. Our employees experience a fantastic quality of life, earning salaries that are higher than both the regional and national average for the tire manufacturing industry.
Giants in the ceramic tile industry such as Florium USA, Dal-Tile Corporation, Landmark Ceramics, Rainbow, Inc. and Smalticeram USA Inc. greatly benefit from the abundance of Tennessee’s natural resources and raw materials used in the ceramics and clay industry, such as plastic, feldspar and ball clay. In fact, we are the #1 state for ball clay mining; 90% of U.S. manufactured tile includes Tennessee ball clay. This yields a few more #1’s for Tennessee—we are the #1 state for the growth in ceramics establishments and the #1 state for growth in ceramics employment concentration. $33 Million in clay products are exported annually from Tennessee.
Tennessee is the right place at the right time to manufacture advanced materials. An ideal location, skilled workforce and competitive wage mean a more efficient operation and increased revenues.

We Proudly Serve the World.
We’ve created an environment unbound by state borders. No other state is more competitive in recruiting foreign direct investment or in exporting products enjoyed the world over. We’ve established resources that make Tennessee accessible to any international market.




We’re in it for the long term. By investing in a broader international footprint, we’ve ensured that Tennessee is firmly entrenched in the new global economy.
The Volunteer State is home to 967 foreign-based businesses that have invested over $37.3 billion in capital and employ more than 147,000 Tennesseans. Tennessee continues to proactively identify and recruit new foreign direct investment (FDI) to the state alongside efforts to increase Tennessee exports. Our state has offices courting foreign direct investment in Japan, South Korea, China, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. We work closely with our federal partners to promote exports, which totaled more than $33.2 billion in 2017. This investment demonstrates Tennessee’s commitment to competing globally for business and jobs, which is not something that most states can claim.
In 2017, the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development received 39 project commitments from foreign-owned businesses, resulting in 6,966 job commitments and $2.52 billion in capital investment. This FDI accounted for nearly one-third of all Tennessee’s new jobs committed in 2017 and 56.0 percent of all capital investment committed in the state.  These major foreign projects included Japanese-owned Denso Manufacturing (1,000 new jobs, $1 billion in capital investment), Netherlands-owned Philips Electronics (815 new jobs, $17.0 million in capital investment), Korean-owned LG Electronics (600 new jobs, $250.6 million in capital investment), and Finland-owned Nokian Tyres (400 new jobs, $360 million capital investment).
We believe in high expectations, low debt and a pro-business regulatory environment. Tennessee is proud to be a right-to-work state with no personal income tax on wages. Our state and local tax burdens are some of the lowest in the country. We have the lowest debt per capita among U.S. states and Tennessee’s budget operates with a healthy surplus.
