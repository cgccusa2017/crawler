Prime Location
    
West Virginia is strategically located on the East Coast.
Direct access without the inconveniences. 
West Virginia is located in the heart of Appalachia and offers access to major metropolitan areas including Washington, DC, New York City, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Charlotte, Raleigh, Columbus, Chicago, Lexington and Atlanta – without the big city inconveniences. West Virginia’s location puts business and industry within an eight-hour driving distance to half of the U.S. population and a third of the Canadian market.
 
Global gateway in the heart of West Virginia.
 
West Virginia is also home to a newly constructed road-to-rail cargo transfer station, known as the Heartland Intermodal Gateway. Located in Prichard, West Virginia, the site was strategically selected as it sits exactly one mile from the center point of the Norfolk Southern Heartland Corridor.


The Heartland Intermodal Gateway spans across 100 acres of land. In addition to the neighboring Norfolk Southern rail line, the facility has direct access to U.S. Route 52, I-64, U.S. Route 23 and is located along the I-73/I-74 Corridor and Big Sandy River.
The facility is operated by Parsec and offers state-of-the-art equipment and services, including: 

A weigh in motion (WIM) scale
Two Tier IV Diesel Taylor Reach Stackers to accommodate containers ranging from 20 to 53 feet
Gated entrance and exit
Motion-detecting PTZ cameras onsite
24/7 remote access viewing for site security to ensure shipments are safe and secure

The Heartland Intermodal Gateway offers substantial cost savings, as companies that ship through the facility are projected to save more than $600 per container, when compared to direct trucking to the Port of Virginia. The facility also is projected to reduce private sector logistics costs by approximately $17.5 million annually by 2025.


Solid infrastructure to connect West Virginia businesses to the entire United States.
West Virginia is conveniently connected to the East Coast and Continental U.S. by an intricate system of airways, railways, waterways and highways.
West Virginia has 7 commercial service and 25 general aviation airports conveniently located throughout the state to connect your business to the world. West Virginia offers nearly 420 miles of navigable waterways, with five navigable rivers connecting to international shipping ports. Economic hotspots have developed along the six major interstates that run through our state, in particular the I-81 corridor. And between connections with Norfolk Southern and CSX Transportation, West Virginia has more than 1,900 route miles of railroads. 



Small city protection, big city value.
West Virginia is outside the federal blast zone and insulated from natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes.
 

Our location, coupled with our connections, make global access easy in West Virginia. Let our strategic location work for you.

Development Assistance


 
Let us help your business succeed.
West Virginia makes it a priority to meet the needs of our business partners. To help, the state provides development assistance in the form of tax credits, financing programs and workforce training programs. This support can reduce startup and operating costs and provide for enhanced productivity that will allow your business to grow and prosper in West Virginia.
 

Learn about our tax credits.
Aircraft Valuation
Aircraft owned or leased by commercial airlines, charter carriers, private carriers and private companies are valued for property tax purposes at the lower of fair market salvage value or five percent of the original cost of the property.

Commercial Patent Incentives Credit
The Commercial Patent Incentives Tax Credit can offset up to 100 percent of the corporation net income tax, or in the case of individual taxpayers, the personal income tax. The credit is based on a percentage of royalties, license fees and other considerations for developers of a patent or a percentage of net profit attributable to a patent used in a manufacturing process or product when that patent has been developed in conjunction with an agreement with Marshall University or West Virginia University.

Corporate Headquarters Credit
Companies that relocate their corporate headquarters to West Virginia are eligible for tax credits if 15 new jobs (including relocated employees) are created within the first year. The credit can offset up to 100 percent of the tax liability for business and occupation tax, corporate net income tax, and personal income tax on certain pass through income, for a period of up to 13 years.

Economic Opportunity Credit
For qualified companies that create at least 20 new jobs within specified time limits (10 jobs in the case of qualified small businesses) as a result of their business expansion projects, the State's Economic Opportunity Tax Credit can offset up to 80 percent of the corporate net income tax and personal income tax (on flow through income only) attributable to qualified investment. If a qualified company that creates the requisite number of jobs pays an annual median wage higher than the statewide average non-farm payroll wage, then the qualified company can offset up to 100 percent of the corporate net income tax and personal income tax (on flow through income only) attributable to qualified investment.
For qualified businesses creating less than 20 new jobs within specified time limits, or for a qualified small business creating less than 10 new jobs, a $3,000 credit is allowed per new full-time job for five years, providing the new job pays at least $32,000 per year and the employee has employer-provided health insurance benefits. The $32,000 figure is adjusted annually for cost of living.
Qualified businesses include only those engaged in the activities of manufacturing, information processing, warehousing, non-retail goods distribution, qualified research and development, the relocation of a corporate headquarters, or destination-oriented recreation and tourism.
The Freeport Amendment
The Freeport Amendment exempts property from the West Virginia ad valorem property tax in two ways. First, manufactured products produced in West Virginia and stored in the state for a short time before moving into interstate commerce are exempt from property tax. Second, goods transported into West Virginia from outside of the state, which are held for a short time in a warehouse and then shipped to a destination outside of West Virginia, are exempt from the property tax.
The exemption does not apply to inventories of raw materials or goods in process.
Five for Twenty-Five Program - $2 Billion Primary (Fractionating) Plants, Secondary Plants and Tertiary Plants
For 25 years, qualified plants receive a special property tax valuation of five percent of the cost of the qualified property instead of fair market value.

Five for Ten Program – Fractionating Plants and Secondary Plants
Special property tax valuation applies for 10 years to real property (excluding the value of unimproved land) and personal property of facilities that are or will be classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) with the six digit code number 211112 (natural gas liquid extraction "fractionating" plants) and to manufacturing facilities that use products produced at a facility with a 211112 NAICS code.
The special property tax valuation applies to qualified capital additions of more than million made to pre-existing manufacturing facilities that have a value in place before the capital addition of more than million. The special property tax valuation is 5 percent of the cost of the qualified property instead of fair market value.
In the absence of a pre-existing manufacturing facility owned or operated by the person making the capital addition, multiple party projects may be established to meet the million pre-existing investment requirement.
High-Tech Manufacturing Credit
Businesses that manufacture certain computers and peripheral equipment, electronic components or semi-conductors and which create at least 20 new jobs within one year after placement of qualified investment into service, can receive a tax credit to offset 100 percent of the business and occupation tax, corporate net income tax, and personal income tax on certain pass through income for 20 consecutive years.

High Technology Valuation Act (Data Centers)
Tangible personal property, including servers, directly used in a high-technology business or in an internet advertising business, is valued for property tax purposes at five percent of the original cost of the property. In addition, sales tax is eliminated from all purchases of prewritten computer software, computers, computer hardware, servers, building materials and tangible personal property for direct use in a high-technology business or internet advertising business.

Lodging Exemptions
For lodging stays in excess of 30 consecutive days per person at the same facility, there is an exemption from the state consumers sales and service tax (six percent) and exemption from the local hotel/motel tax (tax rate varies per region.)

Manufacturing Inventory Credit
Offsets the corporate net income tax in the amount of property tax paid on raw materials, goods in process and finished goods manufacturing inventory.

Manufacturing Investment Credit
A tax credit is allowed against up to 60 percent of corporate net income tax and based on qualified investment in eligible manufacturing property, with no new job creation required.

Manufacturing Sales Tax Exemption
Purchases of materials and equipment for direct use in manufacturing are exempt from the six percent state sales and use tax, including building materials and process equipment purchased for construction of a manufacturing facility.

Research and Development Sales Tax Exemption
Purchases of tangible personal property and services directly used in research and development are exempt from the consumer sales tax.

Sales Tax Exemption for Certain E-Commerce Businesses
Some computer-related sales of tangible personal property and services are exempt from the consumer sales and services tax.
Sales Tax Exemption for Certain Warehouse and Distribution Centers
Purchases of certain tangible personal property in qualified warehouse and distribution centers may be exempt from the consumer sales and service tax.

Tax Increment Financing
Allows increases in property tax based on the improvement associated with qualified economic development and public improvement projects to assist with their long-term financing.

The Tourism Matching Advertising Partnership Program
In order to extend advertising resources for the promotion of tourism through partnerships, this program provides reimbursable matching funds for direct advertising. Business applicants and their partners must provide a minimum of 50 percent of the total cost for programs at the, 000 + level. For programs not exceeding, 500, business applicants must provide 25 percent of the total cost.
West Virginia Film Industry Investment Act
Up to 31 percent of direct-production and post-production expenditures can be converted to transferable tax credits to offset state taxes. Also, purchases and rentals of tangible personal property and purchases of services (excluding gasoline or special fuel, food or beverages) directly used in the activity of manufacturing a motion picture, TV program, music video, or commercial are exempt from the consumer sales and service tax and use tax.

Workforce Innovation & Opportunity Act

The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act aligns training with needed skills and matches employers with qualified workers. It provides incumbent worker training and promotes work-based training— increasing on-the-job training reimbursement rates to 75 percent.

The employer also benefits by being reimbursed for part of the participant's wages during the training period, while having the services of a full-time employee.

Market Finder Reimbursement

 
Highly motivated eligible businesses will work with the Export Promotion Program of the West Virginia Development Office to explore new markets of opportunity using the Initial Market Check  and other services offered by the U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This service provides an initial assessment of market potential of a product or service in a targeted market by gathering feedback from up to five industry participants and provides a recommendation on whether to pursue the target market.

Market Finder Reimbursements will be awarded to eligible small businesses to offset 75% of the cost of the market study. The remaining 25% will be considered a required matching contribution by the applicant. The maximum reimbursement per participating business per funding year under this program is $1,500. Participating businesses are welcome to compete for additional funding using any of the other available West Virginia First STEP- Next STEP reimbursement programs. The West Virginia First STEP-Next STEP funding period is October 1, 2018 through September 29, 2020. 

Participating firms will follow up with a proposed export strategy to pursue at least one of the target markets based on the results of the study.  Proposed export strategies must include the execution of an export marketing activity such as participation in trade shows, sales trips, product demonstrations, website marketing, and the Gold Key Service. Proposed export marketing activities can be funded by the West Virginia First STEP-Next STEP Program if it is available and all the eligibility criteria is met.

Applicants must demonstrate sufficient export readiness, resources and experience to enter or expand into new markets and a high level of commitment to follow up on the results of the market study.

Japan

West Virginia's Nagoya Office celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2015. Nagoya is a manufacturing and shipping hub about three hours from Tokyo, and West Virginia's continued presence and relationship-building there has been largely responsible for the automotive manufacturing companies that have located in West Virginia.
  

  Since 1986, the recruitment of Japanese investment has been a key part of West Virginia’s economic development strategy. The partnership between Japan and West Virginia has been successful, and Governor Jim Justice looks to continue this business relationship. Today, 21 Japanese companies operate in West Virginia and employ more than 3,300 people.

Prime Location

West Virginia is strategically located on the East Coast.
Direct access without the inconveniences. 
West Virginia is located in the heart of Appalachia and offers access to major metropolitan areas including Washington, DC, New York City, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Charlotte, Raleigh, Columbus, Chicago, Lexington and Atlanta – without the big city inconveniences. 
(Insert Strategic Location Map)
West Virginia’s location puts business and industry within an eight-hour driving distance to half of the U.S. population and a third of the Canadian market.
Solid infrastructure to connect West Virginia businesses to the entire United States.
(Insert Infrastructure Map)
West Virginia is conveniently connected to the East Coast and Continental U.S. by an intricate system of railways, waterways and highways.
West Virginia offers nearly 420 miles of navigable waterways, with five navigable rivers connecting to international shipping ports. Economic hotspots have developed along the six major interstates that run through our state, in particular the I-81 corridor. And between connections with Norfolk Southern and CSX Transportation, West Virginia has more than 1,900 route miles of railroads.
Global gateway in the heart of West Virginia.
(Insert HIG logo/map)
West Virginia is also home to a newly constructed road-to-rail cargo transfer station, known as the Heartland Intermodal Gateway. Located in Prichard, West Virginia, the site was strategically selected as it sits exactly one mile from the center point of the Norfolk Southern Heartland Corridor.
The Heartland Intermodal Gateway spans across 100 acres of land. In addition to the neighboring Norfolk Southern rail line, the facility has direct access to U.S. Route 52, I-64, U.S. Route 23 and is located along the I-73/I-74 Corridor and Big Sandy River.
The facility is operated by Parsec and offers state-of-the-art equipment and services, including:

A weigh in motion (WIM) scale
Two Tier IV Diesel Taylor Reach Stackers to accommodate containers ranging from 20 to 53 feet
Gated entrance and exit
Motion-detecting PTZ cameras onsite
24/7 remote access viewing for site security to ensure shipments are safe and secure

The Heartland Intermodal Gateway offers substantial cost savings, as companies that ship through the facility are projected to save more than $600 per container, when compared to direct trucking to the Port of Virginia. The facility also is projected to reduce private sector logistics costs by approximately $17.5 million annually by 2025.

Small city protection, big city value.
West Virginia is outside the federal blast zone and insulated from natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes.
(Insert Safety Map)
Our location, coupled with our connections, make global access easy in West Virginia. Let our strategic location work for you.

Quality of Life


West Virginia is more than just a place for business.
  
  It’s a place where companies, their employees, and their families live and thrive for generations.

We understand large-scale business decisions directly affect the individuals behind the day-to-day operations, which is why we have made it a top priority to ensure a high quality of life for not only our current residents, but those who may one day call the Mountain State their home.


We provide our residents with a low cost of living and high quality of life across the board.

Cost of living in West Virginia is 14% below the national average. The home ownership rate is the highest in the nation, with affordable and safe housing options to meet every individual or family’s needs. Residents can choose to live in urban or suburban communities, small towns or rural areas – all within short commutes to major destinations. West Virginia also offers its residents a merit-based financial aid program called the Promise Scholarship, where students can receive annual awards up to $4,750 to cover in-state tuition costs.


 
West Virginia is rich in history and culture.

Residents and visitors can see the state’s artisanship, history and culture through the many museums found throughout West Virginia.

Sports enthusiasts and fans can take advantage of the state’s two university athletic programs: West Virginia University Mountaineers and the Marshall Thundering Herd, or visit The West Virginia Power at Appalachian Power Park or the West Virginia Black Bears at Monongalia County Ballpark to watch the state’s two minor league baseball teams. Prefer to play? Youth and adult sports programs are offered throughout the state.
Shopping

West Virginia’s cities and communities are booming with an array of shopping options, ranging from local boutique shops and antique stores to major shopping centers. No matter what you’re searching for, you can find it in West Virginia.

Building Products


 

A Solid Foundation


West Virginia's building products industry, with hardwood products leading the way, has the workforce skills, building materials and support services the construction industry needs to build a solid foundation for success. With 11.9 million forested acres, West Virginia is the third most forested state in the nation. The state also has abundant resources such as coal and limestone for making cement. The many coal-fired power plants found in West Virginia create opportunities for companies manufacturing wallboard. Mix those assets with a focus on higher education resources and the West Virginia Wood Technology Center provides training programs in advanced wood manufacturing technologies and you have a state ready to help build for the future.

Market Finder Reimbursement

 
Highly motivated eligible businesses will work with the Export Promotion Program of the West Virginia Development Office to explore new markets of opportunity using the Initial Market Check  and other services offered by the U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This service provides an initial assessment of market potential of a product or service in a targeted market by gathering feedback from up to five industry participants and provides a recommendation on whether to pursue the target market.

Market Finder Reimbursements will be awarded to eligible small businesses to offset 75% of the cost of the market study. The remaining 25% will be considered a required matching contribution by the applicant. The maximum reimbursement per participating business per funding year under this program is $1,500. Participating businesses are welcome to compete for additional funding using any of the other available West Virginia First STEP- Next STEP reimbursement programs. The West Virginia First STEP-Next STEP funding period is October 1, 2018 through September 29, 2020. 

Participating firms will follow up with a proposed export strategy to pursue at least one of the target markets based on the results of the study.  Proposed export strategies must include the execution of an export marketing activity such as participation in trade shows, sales trips, product demonstrations, website marketing, and the Gold Key Service. Proposed export marketing activities can be funded by the West Virginia First STEP-Next STEP Program if it is available and all the eligibility criteria is met.

Applicants must demonstrate sufficient export readiness, resources and experience to enter or expand into new markets and a high level of commitment to follow up on the results of the market study.

West Virginia: Opportunity Zones Program


Enacted as part of the 2017 tax reform package (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), the Opportunity Zones Program gives each state’s Governor the authority to designate “Opportunity Zones” or areas of populations that are eligible to receive private investments through Opportunity Funds. The program is designed to drive long lasting investments into rural and low-income urban communities in every U.S. state and territory.




 
 

Opportunity Zones


Governors can determine up to 25 percent of the total number of eligible areas to be designated as Opportunity Zones.


Low-income census tracts are used to determine eligible areas within each state. Low-income census tracts are places where the individual poverty rate is at least 20 percent or median family income is no greater than 80 percent of the area median.


Up to 5 percent of these population areas that are not low-income communities can qualify under an exemption if the median family income of the tract does not exceed 125 percent of the median family income of the low-income community contiguous with the tract. 

View Maps and Census Tracts



Opportunity Funds 

Opportunity Funds are investment vehicles organized as corporations or partnerships to foster investments into Opportunities Zones holding at least 90% of its assets in designated Opportunity Zones.

Investors who are interested in investing in a potential opportunity zone may submit letters of interest.

Sample letters:


Letter of Interest: Fund manager
Letter of Interest: Investor

Please submit letters of interest to This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it..



How will the Opportunity Zone Program help West Virginia?

The Opportunity Zone Program will drive much needed capital into our state’s struggling communities.



What is the timeline for determining the Opportunity Zones?


Governors have until March 21, 2018 to submit their Opportunity Zone designations to the U.S. Treasury Department or request a 30-day extension.


Once approved, Opportunity Zone designations remain in place for ten years and cannot be modified after initial designation.

 
How will the Governor decide which zones to nominate?

Under the direction of Governor Jim Justice, the WV Department of Commerce will research and make recommendations on which areas in the state of West Virginia should be nominated as Opportunity Zones.


Awareness/Education

The West Virginia Department of Commerce has created this webpage to keep the public informed of the Opportunity Zone recommendation process.
  
Data Analysis/Impact

The West Virginia Department of Commerce is seeking proposals from municipalities and counties. Commerce will use a data driven process to evaluate eligible census tracts. Additionally, Commerce is working with the Federal Reserve, Community Development Financial Institutions, local banks, investors and developers to identify potential projects that could be attractive to Opportunity Funds and investors.
  
Public Proposal Submissions

We need your input!

To properly identify possible nominations for eligible census tracts, the West Virginia Department of Commerce is requesting proposals from city and county governments that can provide, at a minimum, the information found in the Opportunity Zone Proposal, here:
  
Opportunity Zone Proposal

Please note: You may propose tracts only from the list of eligible census tracts in the state. View eligible census tracts in West Virginia here:
  
Census Tracts

All submissions must have a letter of support on official county or city letterhead. If more than one census tract is submitted, tracts should be rank ordered by highest priority.

Business Climate


Let our low business costs and history of fiscal responsibility lead to your long-term success.


Low cost of doing business

West Virginia's cost of doing business is among the lowest in the country and ranks 11th best in CNBC's America's Top States for Business 2017 "cost of doing business" category. 
  

  Our electricity rates are 11 percent (Industrial) below the national average and are lower than all of (all but Ky) our neighboring states. Employee turnover in West Virginia is below the national average at 8.9 percent, compared to the national average of 9.4 percent. We have the lowest turnover rate in manufacturing at 4.8 percent, compared to the national average of 5.4 percent. And to top it off, our overall cost of living is 17 percent lower than the national average. 




 
A track record of fiscal responsibility

West Virginia has made it a top priority to address and respond to the needs of today’s companies by ensuring we offer a stable and predictable business climate.  

  Thanks to aggressive pro-business legislation, West Virginia has some of the lowest worker’s compensation rates in the country. In fact, the state just announced its 14th reduction in workers' compensation rates, which collectively, have saved employers more than $398 million since the fund was privatized in 2006. 

  West Virginia eliminated its Business Franchise Tax in 2015, saving taxpayers more than $500 million from the first reduction to the final elimination. The state's Corporate Net Income Tax rate was reduced to 6.5 percent in 2014, helping corporations to realize more than $53 million per year in net annual tax savings. West Virginia also removed approximately $180 million of business tax burden in FY 2014 and roughly $800 million over the past eight years. 


  More importantly, however, our state has not added any new business taxes in the last 20 years. 

  According to the Tax Foundation's 2019 State Business Tax Climate Index, West Virginia is rated 19th nationally – better than any neighboring state. We also have the third best cash surplus in the U.S. and a “F” Cato Institute Fiscal Policy rating.

 
Let us show you how our business climate can put your company at an advantage.

Market Finder Reimbursement

 
Highly motivated eligible businesses will work with the Export Promotion Program of the West Virginia Development Office to explore new markets of opportunity using the Initial Market Check  and other services offered by the U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This service provides an initial assessment of market potential of a product or service in a targeted market by gathering feedback from up to five industry participants and provides a recommendation on whether to pursue the target market.

Market Finder Reimbursements will be awarded to eligible small businesses to offset 75% of the cost of the market study. The remaining 25% will be considered a required matching contribution by the applicant. The maximum reimbursement per participating business per funding year under this program is $1,500. Participating businesses are welcome to compete for additional funding using any of the other available West Virginia First STEP- Next STEP reimbursement programs. The West Virginia First STEP-Next STEP funding period is October 1, 2018 through September 29, 2020. 

Participating firms will follow up with a proposed export strategy to pursue at least one of the target markets based on the results of the study.  Proposed export strategies must include the execution of an export marketing activity such as participation in trade shows, sales trips, product demonstrations, website marketing, and the Gold Key Service. Proposed export marketing activities can be funded by the West Virginia First STEP-Next STEP Program if it is available and all the eligibility criteria is met.

Applicants must demonstrate sufficient export readiness, resources and experience to enter or expand into new markets and a high level of commitment to follow up on the results of the market study.

Rock Creek Development Park




   


Gateway to Growth and Revitalization in Southern West Virginia


In January 2016 plans to develop the largest mixed-use development project in West Virginia history were announced. The site offers the opportunity to foster many types of development in southern West Virginia.  The State of West Virginia is actively promoting available property for industrial development.
  


   
  




Strategic Location
            

Located in Boone and Lincoln Counties near the border of Logan County in the heart of Southern West Virginia
Within 25 miles of major interstate corridors (I-77, I-79, and I-64)
Prime location adjacent to U.S. Route 119, a major north/south corridor
Less than 30 miles from the Capital City of Charleston and a regional airport




             
          





   
  
   
  





             
          

Site Specifics
            

Approximately 12,000 acres of developable land
Size of the city of Huntington; larger than Morgantown, Wheeling and Parkersburg
Laborshed of more than 400,000 workers, many of whom are highly skilled and displaced
Proximity to rail service by CSX
Large available power grid and natural gas lines in place
The West Virginia Economic Development Authority will oversee property development






     
    
     
    



State’s Commitment to Next Steps
            
The Rock Creek Development Park project is a significant undertaking, but the State of West Virginia is working to bring this vision to fruition. Next step plans for development include transportation access and infrastructure.
            






     
    



Become a Partner
            
The Rock Creek Development Park project represents vast potential to bring about economic restructuring in the southern region of West Virginia, a region that has been affected by the downturn of the coal industry. This project holds great potential for both the region and investors as we chart a brighter course for the Mountain State.

Market Finder Reimbursement

 
Highly motivated eligible businesses will work with the Export Promotion Program of the West Virginia Development Office to explore new markets of opportunity using the Initial Market Check  and other services offered by the U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This service provides an initial assessment of market potential of a product or service in a targeted market by gathering feedback from up to five industry participants and provides a recommendation on whether to pursue the target market.

Market Finder Reimbursements will be awarded to eligible small businesses to offset 75% of the cost of the market study. The remaining 25% will be considered a required matching contribution by the applicant. The maximum reimbursement per participating business per funding year under this program is $1,500. Participating businesses are welcome to compete for additional funding using any of the other available West Virginia First STEP- Next STEP reimbursement programs. The West Virginia First STEP-Next STEP funding period is October 1, 2018 through September 29, 2020. 

Participating firms will follow up with a proposed export strategy to pursue at least one of the target markets based on the results of the study.  Proposed export strategies must include the execution of an export marketing activity such as participation in trade shows, sales trips, product demonstrations, website marketing, and the Gold Key Service. Proposed export marketing activities can be funded by the West Virginia First STEP-Next STEP Program if it is available and all the eligibility criteria is met.

Applicants must demonstrate sufficient export readiness, resources and experience to enter or expand into new markets and a high level of commitment to follow up on the results of the market study.

Energy


 

Abundant Advantage


Vast natural gas reserves have been discovered in the Marcellus, Rogersville and Utica shale formations beneath West Virginia. The abundant supply presents tremendous opportunities to shift the cost structure of energy, revitalize the chemical/polymer industry and stimulate downstream manufacturing. A long history of energy production creates familiarity with the industry within many of our communities. The convenient location makes it ideal for companies seeking close proximity to natural gas storage fields, gathering and transmission lines. West Virginia was one of the first states in the region to establish a drilling regulatory framework, setting clear rules to protect the interests of the environment, landowners and industry.

Growing Infrastructure

West Virginia in the midst of hundreds of miles of new and expanding gathering and interstate pipeline projects. The new infrastructure will transport natural gas to customers and industry. West Virginia contains 30 underground natural gas storage fields in close proximity to northeastern markets, making the state well positioned as a supplier to the region during the peak demand winter months.

 


 

 

Training & Education

Our educational and vocational institutions partner with industry to offer customized training programs as well as industry-specific custom technical and knowledge upgrade training.

 

Proximity to Resources

Byrd Institute for Advanced Flexible Manufacturing (RCBI), which includes the nationally-certified RCBI Machinist Technology Program. The RCBI Machinist Technology program meets standards set by the National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS). These skills combined with many technical programs and partnerships help build a ready workforce.

Discoveries



Strengthening Existing Industries
These simple principles led us to discoveries that can change the   future of West Virginia. Discoveries such as our state having many   robust industries that we can grow, such as aerospace maintenance,   repair and overhaul; automotive parts manufacturing; and metals   manufacturing.
Differentiation
West Virginia also has sectors that are growing more slowly here than   nationally, but we can succeed by differentiating ourselves from the   competition. One area is downstream oil and gas manufacturing,   specifically in carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics and fine chemicals.
Creating New Sectors
New sectors the state can capture that promise high growth are   cybersecurity, cloud services and data centers, and higher-end tourism.   And two areas that create distinct opportunities in West Virginia are   the life sciences and automotive assembly.
Attracting New Businesses
We must also turn our attention to creating incentives for innovation   and business development. For example, we should consider creating a   one-stop shop that aligns current resources with business needs and   directs businesses to the right offices for help, thus nurturing a   business-friendly environment.
And though the state’s infrastructure poses challenges, we must   improve roads and bridges, increase broadband access and develop a   landscape where data centers can thrive.
Developing Our People
Perhaps our biggest opportunity is also our biggest asset: our   people. However, circumstances such as a mismatch between labor supply   and demand, the opioid crisis and large waves of out-migration have left   that asset in short supply.
If we can create jobs and the space where businesses can succeed, West Virginians will come home.
We can do this by building our future talent pool, especially in STEM   areas, and expanding vocational training. We need to improve the health   and skill of our existing workforce to attract employers, and we need   to engage our universities’ alumni to reach out to the talent we have   lost.

About Us

 
West Virginia Forward Defined

West Virginia Forward is a collaboration among the West Virginia Department of Commerce, West Virginia University, and Marshall University to identify short-term, larger-scale projects that will boost West Virginia’s economic development efforts. The collaboration was supported by analysis from McKinsey & Company, which was focused on trending business sectors that could provide potential avenues for job growth and economic stability.

Data Collection

For the past several months, there have been working groups with staff from the West Virginia Department of Commerce, West Virginia University, and Marshall University, and McKinsey. In addition, we have met with state business experts, the Chamber of Commerce, the National Guard, Vision Shared, Imagine, the Business Roundtable, Tech Connect and Discover the Real West Virginia Foundation to ensure we are gaining feedback from all of the State’s partners.

Areas of Growth

While all possibilities are being considered, a few key opportunities include workforce, business climate, entrepreneurship and infrastructure. In the past, the State and other organizations have addressed specific areas of concern. However, this collaborative partnership aims to look at West Virginia’s assets from a global perspective and pair them with economic trends we can leverage for future growth. The report will be specific for West Virginia. It will be aspirational but realistic, and there will be no other report like it in the region. The state has phenomenal assets, such as energy and healthcare. But we need to know what business sectors are most likely to grow in the coming years and then determine if we have the right attributes to attract them here.

Why this is Important

The state is in a transition economy. Our communities are struggling while jobs have disappeared. Our talent has been forced to leave the state they love to pursue opportunity. We need to embrace all that West Virginia has to offer and believe that we can create a new path forward. It is not about rising from the bottom of a poll or stat. It’s about moving West Virginia Forward.

Next Steps

Our next steps include asking each stakeholder to undertake projects to implement these recommendations. With our partners West Virginia University and Marshall University we are in the final stages of executing a Memorandum of Understanding that formalizes the partnership through commitments from each, outlining specific actions and dedicating resources. Teams have been in preliminary discussions, and implementation meetings will start in September. We will be reaching out to experts across the state to work together as we move forward.

Cost to Taxpayers

Nothing. The research and report were paid for through the support of private donors and foundations.

Fulfillment Distribution


 

Logistical Advantage


West Virginia is home to distribution and fulfillment centers for renowned companies. The Mountain State delivers the logistical and operational advantages these successful businesses seek. A highly skilled workforce combined with low energy costs and a strategic location are the key reasons companies have created a base of operations in West Virginia. In addition to major highways I-79, I-77, I-64 and I-70, the Eastern Panhandle sits on the I-81 corridor. West Virginia is within overnight reach of 74 percent of the U.S. polyols market and 79 percent of the country's auto body, part manufacturing and assembly plants, making it the perfect location.

Fulfillment Distribution Industry Leaders in West Virginia 
 

Strategic Location

West Virginia is within easy range - eight hours if you drive, faster if you fly - of half the U.S. population and a third of the Canadian market.

In addition to major highways I-79, I-77, I-64 and I-70, the Eastern Panhandle sits on the I-81 corridor. Airports and railroads provide additional options for efficient distribution and shipping of products to customers.

 





World-class workforce with turnover rate
below national average and tied for
3rd-lowest for manufacturing.



Pro-business tax-climate with no new
business taxes in the last 20 years.
Business franchise tax eliminated in 2015.



Fiscally responsible state government with
Fitch credit rating AA+ for general debt
obligation and overall stable outlook



Low cost of living 14% lower than
national average with safe communities
and unparalleled outdoor
recreation opportunities



Electricity rates more than 33% lower
than the national average



Employers have saved more than
$280 million since the state privatized the
Worker's Compensation fund in 2006



Cost of doing business 14% below the
national average




 

Educational and Training Resources

Educational/vocational institutions partner with industry to offer customized training programs. The Governor's Guaranteed Work Force Training Program offers assistance to eligible companies to support industry-specific custom technical and knowledge upgrade training.

 

 


 

 

Employer-friendly Business Climate

Thanks to aggressive pro-business legislation, we offer some of the lowest worker's compensation rates in the country.

 

Pro-growth Tax Reforms

The state has reduced taxes such as the Corporate Net Income Tax and gradually eliminated others, including the Business Franchise Tax.

 

Transportation

West Virginia is connected to the East Coast and Continental United States by highways, railways and navigable waterways. The new Heartland Intermodal Gateway provides clearance for double-stack rail cars from Roanoke, Virginia, through southern West Virginia to Chicago.

 

Qualified and Available Workforce

Thousands of highly skilled and experienced technical workers are available and ready to work. Unique education/industry partnerships create customizable programs to equip workers with industry-specific skills and know-how.

 

Quality of Life

The cost of living is low and the quality of life is high, with safe communities and outdoor recreation opportunities that include biking, hiking, golfing, skiing and whitewater rafting.

 

Research & Technology

Uncommon capabilities can be found at groups such as Mid-Atlantic Technology, Research and Innovation Center (MATRIC); and the Robert C. Byrd Institute for Advanced Flexible Manufacturing (RCBI), which includes the nationally-certified RCBI Machinist Technology Program. The RCBI Machinist Technology program meets standards set by the National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS). These skills combined with many technical programs and partnerships help build a ready workforce.

Market Finder Reimbursement

 
Highly motivated eligible businesses will work with the Export Promotion Program of the West Virginia Development Office to explore new markets of opportunity using the Initial Market Check  and other services offered by the U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce. This service provides an initial assessment of market potential of a product or service in a targeted market by gathering feedback from up to five industry participants and provides a recommendation on whether to pursue the target market.

Market Finder Reimbursements will be awarded to eligible small businesses to offset 75% of the cost of the market study.

Market Finder Reimbursements will be awarded to eligible small businesses to offset 75% of the cost of the market study. The remaining 25% will be considered a required matching contribution by the applicant. The maximum reimbursement per participating business per funding year under this program is $1,500. Participating businesses are welcome to compete for additional funding using any of the other available West Virginia First STEP- Next STEP reimbursement programs. The West Virginia First STEP-Next STEP funding period is October 1, 2018 through September 29, 2020. 

Participating firms will follow up with a proposed export strategy to pursue at least one of the target markets based on the results of the study.  Proposed export strategies must include the execution of an export marketing activity such as participation in trade shows, sales trips, product demonstrations, website marketing, and the Gold Key Service. Proposed export marketing activities can be funded by the West Virginia First STEP-Next STEP Program if it is available and all the eligibility criteria is met.

Applicants must demonstrate sufficient export readiness, resources and experience to enter or expand into new markets and a high level of commitment to follow up on the results of the market study.

FAQ

 
What is West Virginia Forward?

West Virginia Forward is a collaboration among the West Virginia Department of Commerce,  West Virginia University, and Marshall University to identify short-term, larger-scale projects that will boost West Virginia’s economic development efforts. The collaboration was supported by analysis from McKinsey & Company, which was focused on how West Virginia’s assets may be aligned with trending business sectors to provide potential avenues for job growth and economic stability.

Why is West Virginia Forward important?

The state is in a transition economy. Our communities are struggling while jobs have disappeared. Our talent has been forced to leave the state they love to pursue opportunity. We need to embrace all the opportunities West Virginia has to offer and believe that we can create a new path forward. It is not about rising from the bottom of a poll or stat. It’s about moving West Virginia Forward.

Why was McKinsey & Company chosen to do the analysis?

McKinsey & Company is a global management consulting firm that serves leading businesses, governments, non-governmental organizations, and not-for-profits. We worked with McKinsey due to their expertise and success in providing the critical information organizations need to create change.

Who are the other partners involved in this project?

For the past several months, there have been working groups with staff from the Department of Commerce, West Virginia University, Marshall University, and McKinsey. In addition, we have met with lawmakers, economic development experts, community leaders, educators, business owners, the Chamber of Commerce, the National Guard, Vision Shared, Imagine, the Business Roundtable, Tech Connect, Discover the Real West Virginia Foundation and others to begin the process of soliciting feedback from stakeholders across the State.

What areas of growth are being considered?

While all possibilities are being considered, a few key opportunities include workforce, business climate, entrepreneurship and infrastructure. In the past, the State and other organizations have addressed specific areas of concern. However, this collaborative partnership aims to look at West Virginia’s assets from a global perspective and pair them with economic trends we can leverage for future growth.

How will this be different than other reports the State has done?

The report will be specific for West Virginia and our current economic landscape, and it will address implementation. It will be aspirational but realistic, and there are no other reports like it in the region. The state has phenomenal assets, such as energy, healthcare and its people. But we need to take stock of our economic assets, understand what business sectors are most likely to grow in the coming years and then determine if we have the right attributes to attract them here.

What are the next steps?

Next steps include asking each partner to undertake projects to implement these recommendations. The Department of Commerce, West Virginia University, and Marshall University are entering into a Memorandum of Understanding that formalizes the partnership through commitments from each, outlining specific actions and dedicating resources. The partners have been in preliminary discussions and implementation meetings will start in September. Then work will begin to address the recommendations in cooperation with subject matter experts around the state and region. The completed report will be done around mid-September. We will share information when the final report is available.

How much is this costing taxpayers?

Nothing. The research and report was paid through the support of private donors and foundations.

How can I get involved?

It is vital that every West Virginian get involved. And there are many opportunities at the community, state and regional levels. If you would like to volunteer or have an idea, you can contact us here. And use this website to stay current with projects and progress.

Commercial Patent Incentives Credit
The Commercial Patent Incentives Tax Credit can offset up to 100 percent of the corporation net income tax, or in the case of individual taxpayers, the personal income tax. The credit is based on a percentage of royalties, license fees and other considerations for developers of a patent or a percentage of net profit attributable to a patent used in a manufacturing process or product when that patent has been developed in conjunction with an agreement with Marshall University or West Virginia University.

Corporate Headquarters Credit
Companies that relocate their corporate headquarters to West Virginia are eligible for tax credits if 15 new jobs (including relocated employees) are created within the first year.

Economic Opportunity Credit
For qualified companies that create at least 20 new jobs within specified time limits (10 jobs in the case of qualified small businesses) as a result of their business expansion projects, the State's Economic Opportunity Tax Credit can offset up to 80 percent of the corporate net income tax and personal income tax (on flow through income only) attributable to qualified investment. If a qualified company that creates the requisite number of jobs pays an annual median wage higher than the statewide average non-farm payroll wage, then the qualified company can offset up to 100 percent of the corporate net income tax and personal income tax (on flow through income only) attributable to qualified investment.
For qualified businesses creating less than 20 new jobs within specified time limits, or for a qualified small business creating less than 10 new jobs, a $3,000 credit is allowed per new full-time job for five years, providing the new job pays at least $32,000 per year and the employee has employer-provided health insurance benefits. The $32,000 figure is adjusted annually for cost of living.

The special property tax valuation applies to qualified capital additions of more than million made to pre-existing manufacturing facilities that have a value in place before the capital addition of more than million. The special property tax valuation is 5 percent of the cost of the qualified property instead of fair market value.
In the absence of a pre-existing manufacturing facility owned or operated by the person making the capital addition, multiple party projects may be established to meet the million pre-existing investment requirement.
High-Tech Manufacturing Credit
Businesses that manufacture certain computers and peripheral equipment, electronic components or semi-conductors and which create at least 20 new jobs within one year after placement of qualified investment into service, can receive a tax credit to offset 100 percent of the business and occupation tax, corporate net income tax, and personal income tax on certain pass through income for 20 consecutive years.

Business Climate


Let our low business costs and history of fiscal responsibility lead to your long-term success.


Low cost of doing business

West Virginia's cost of doing business is among the lowest in the country and ranks 11th best in CNBC's America's Top States for Business 2017 "cost of doing business" category. 
  

  Our electricity rates are 11 percent (Industrial) below the national average and are lower than all of (all but Ky) our neighboring states. Employee turnover in West Virginia is below the national average at 8.9 percent, compared to the national average of 9.4 percent. We have the lowest turnover rate in manufacturing at 4.8 percent, compared to the national average of 5.4 percent. And to top it off, our overall cost of living is 17 percent lower than the national average. 




 
A track record of fiscal responsibility

West Virginia has made it a top priority to address and respond to the needs of today’s companies by ensuring we offer a stable and predictable business climate.  

  Thanks to aggressive pro-business legislation, West Virginia has some of the lowest worker’s compensation rates in the country. In fact, the state just announced its 14th reduction in workers' compensation rates, which collectively, have saved employers more than $398 million since the fund was privatized in 2006. 

  West Virginia eliminated its Business Franchise Tax in 2015, saving taxpayers more than $500 million from the first reduction to the final elimination. The state's Corporate Net Income Tax rate was reduced to 6.5 percent in 2014, helping corporations to realize more than $53 million per year in net annual tax savings. West Virginia also removed approximately $180 million of business tax burden in FY 2014 and roughly $800 million over the past eight years. 


  More importantly, however, our state has not added any new business taxes in the last 20 years. 

  According to the Tax Foundation's 2019 State Business Tax Climate Index, West Virginia is rated 19th nationally – better than any neighboring state. We also have the third best cash surplus in the U.S. and a “F” Cato Institute Fiscal Policy rating.

West Virginia: Opportunity Zones Program


Enacted as part of the 2017 tax reform package (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), the Opportunity Zones Program gives each state’s Governor the authority to designate “Opportunity Zones” or areas of populations that are eligible to receive private investments through Opportunity Funds. The program is designed to drive long lasting investments into rural and low-income urban communities in every U.S. state and territory.




 
 

Opportunity Zones


Governors can determine up to 25 percent of the total number of eligible areas to be designated as Opportunity Zones.


Low-income census tracts are used to determine eligible areas within each state. Low-income census tracts are places where the individual poverty rate is at least 20 percent or median family income is no greater than 80 percent of the area median.


Up to 5 percent of these population areas that are not low-income communities can qualify under an exemption if the median family income of the tract does not exceed 125 percent of the median family income of the low-income community contiguous with the tract. 

View Maps and Census Tracts



Opportunity Funds 

Opportunity Funds are investment vehicles organized as corporations or partnerships to foster investments into Opportunities Zones holding at least 90% of its assets in designated Opportunity Zones.

Investors who are interested in investing in a potential opportunity zone may submit letters of interest.

Sample letters:


Letter of Interest: Fund manager
Letter of Interest: Investor

Please submit letters of interest to This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it..



How will the Opportunity Zone Program help West Virginia?

The Opportunity Zone Program will drive much needed capital into our state’s struggling communities.



What is the timeline for determining the Opportunity Zones?


Governors have until March 21, 2018 to submit their Opportunity Zone designations to the U.S. Treasury Department or request a 30-day extension.


Once approved, Opportunity Zone designations remain in place for ten years and cannot be modified after initial designation.

 
How will the Governor decide which zones to nominate?

Under the direction of Governor Jim Justice, the WV Department of Commerce will research and make recommendations on which areas in the state of West Virginia should be nominated as Opportunity Zones.


Awareness/Education

The West Virginia Department of Commerce has created this webpage to keep the public informed of the Opportunity Zone recommendation process.
  
Data Analysis/Impact

The West Virginia Department of Commerce is seeking proposals from municipalities and counties. Commerce will use a data driven process to evaluate eligible census tracts. Additionally, Commerce is working with the Federal Reserve, Community Development Financial Institutions, local banks, investors and developers to identify potential projects that could be attractive to Opportunity Funds and investors.
  
Public Proposal Submissions

We need your input!

To properly identify possible nominations for eligible census tracts, the West Virginia Department of Commerce is requesting proposals from city and county governments that can provide, at a minimum, the information found in the Opportunity Zone Proposal, here:
  
Opportunity Zone Proposal

Please note: You may propose tracts only from the list of eligible census tracts in the state. View eligible census tracts in West Virginia here:
  
Census Tracts

All submissions must have a letter of support on official county or city letterhead. If more than one census tract is submitted, tracts should be rank ordered by highest priority.
