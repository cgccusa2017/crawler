Life in Georgia






Infrastructure
Georgia is No. 1 for U.S. distribution and supply chain hubs — and No. 2 for infrastructure and access to global markets (Area Development). Georgia also offers a robust rail and highway infrastructure. It’s home to the busiest airport in the world (Hartsfield-Jackson) and one of the busiest ports in the US (Port of Savannah), plus the intersection of two of the nation’s largest fiber-optic trunk routes.











Direct access to U.S. and global markets from the busiest airport in the world 


International distribution becomes significantly easier when your business is near the most traveled airport in the world. 2,700 flights arrive and depart each day from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), and the airport moves 100 million passengers and more than 650,000 metric tons of cargo annually.
Direct flights are available to 150 U.S. cities and 70 international cities in 50 countries. You can reach 80% of the U.S. market in a two-hour flight – or less. In 2018, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was named “most efficient” airport anywhere by the Air Transport Research Society – for the 15th year in a row.
The airport’s total cargo warehouse space is 1.3 million square feet. Plenty of service personnel are available at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to help send your products on their way — more than 100 licensed customs brokers, 200 freight forwarders and 100 trucking companies.





70 international cities are a single flight away. 









Savannah: the nation’s second-busiest container exporter


Deepwater ports in Savannah and Brunswick are Georgia businesses’ gateway to the globe and some of the busiest ports in the US.
The Port of Savannah is the largest single container terminal in North America and the second-busiest U.S. container port. It’s also the nation’s fastest-growing container exporter.
It’s simple to transport your products to and from the port:
A high-speed truck route runs directly from the terminal to I-95 (eastern seaboard) and I-16 (to Atlanta and beyond).
Georgia’s two Class I railroads, Norfolk Southern and CSX, are located on the terminal.
Overnight train service runs throughout Georgia and to four other states: Alabama, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina.
By truck, it’s just a four-hour drive from Savannah to Atlanta, Charlotte and Orlando.
The Port of Savannah is expected to complete a major expansion project by 2022. The expansion will deepen the river from 42 to 47 feet to accommodate larger New Panamax cargo ships, and save businesses an estimated $174 million per year.
The Port of Brunswick is No. 1 among busiest ports in the US for new auto imports. More than 30 manufacturers of auto and heavy equipment use this port to move cargo. Several of them use more than 500 acres to process imports and exports – and another 600 acres are available for expansion. All of this is a quick 2.5-mile drive from I-95 and U.S.-17. Additionally, Class I railroad lines Norfolk Southern and CSX are available at the terminal.
Exporters and importers can speed their freight to and from Georgia’s ports via Georgia’s two inland ports —one in the southern portion of the state, the other in the north. These inland gateways to Georgia’s deepwater ports provide an efficient option to an all-truck-dray to and from the ports for target markets.
Cordele Inland Port in southwest Georgia gives exporters and importers in southwest Georgia, southern Alabama and western Florida a direct 200-mile rail route from Cordele to Georgia’s ports on the Atlantic coast.
Appalachian Regional Port provides exclusive CSX rail service on a direct, 388-mile rail route between the Port of Savannah and companies in northwest Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.





Solve your supply chain challenges with faster, more efficient — and more cost effective — shipping routes 









80% of the U.S. market is less than 2 days away by land


Rated No. 3 in the nation for rail accessibility by Area Development Magazine, Georgia has one of the most extensive railway systems in the U.S.  
Georgia is served by both of the Eastern U.S. Class I railroads, CSX and Norfolk Southern, along with 24 short line railroads. These rail providers travel on 5,000 miles of track, moving nearly 200 million tons of cargo each year. By locating your business in Georgia, you gain access to more miles of rail than any other state in the Southeast.
Georgia’s railroads work hand-in-hand with our seaports, and the $126.7 million Mason Mega Rail Terminal Project now underway will improve the efficiency of both. The project will double the annual rail capacity of the Port of Savannah to 1 million container lifts. By 2020, the Port of Savannah will host the largest on-terminal rail facility in all of North America.
Georgia’s six U.S. interstates — 1,200 miles of highway — connect you to 80% of the country in two days or less of driving time.





Soon to be: North America's largest on-terminal rail facility









Access to the world’s fastest information networks


Get ultra-fast internet access in metro Atlanta, a key Southeast hub for fiber optic infrastructure. Two of the nation’s largest fiber optic trunk lines intersect in Atlanta, along with two major research lines (Internet2 and the National Lambda Rail). 
Atlanta also has the advantage of core interconnection points from nearly every international and domestic fiber provider. AT&T and Comcast offer gigabit internet service, and Google Fiber is coming soon. 
Atlanta’s fiber infrastructure is reliable, robust and easy to access, giving your business the competitive edge in high-tech and data-rich industries. 
 





A robust and reliable fiber optic infrastructure gives you that nano-second edge. 









The world’s largest cold storage network calls Georgia home


Georgia’s 80+ cold chain facilities provide a dependable infrastructure for moving your perishables and temperature-sensitive products. If cold storage is part of your infrastructure needs, consider:
Georgia offers the 8th largest refrigerated space capacity of any U.S. state, with 80+ cold chain facilities and more than 19.5 million square feet of cold storage.
The Port of Savannah offers more refrigerated container capacity than any other port terminal on the East Coast or Gulf Coast, enabling it to handle 40% of the nation’s containerized poultry exports.
Three out of the five top global companies for refrigerated warehousing are located in Georgia, and two are headquartered here — including Americold, the largest cold storage warehousing company in the world.
In 2013, logistics giant UPS opened a second cold chain facility in Georgia. At 35,000 sq. ft., it’s the company’s largest cold chain facility in the U.S., with technological innovations that make the facility more efficient and productive. 





“We are pioneering cold chain technology here in Georgia.” 
 - David Quintilio, VP Operations, UPS Supply Chain Solutions

Life in Georgia






Workforce & Education
From top-ranking colleges and universities to Georgia Quick Start — the No. 1 workforce development program in the country — Georgia invests in preparing talent. Locate or expand here, and you’ll find a versatile Georgia workforce that can meet a variety of needs. You’ll also be doing business in an employment-at-will and right-to-work state, with low unionization.











A pool of talent that runs deep


Georgia is where people want to work – especially young people. A few key metrics that define Georgia’s workforce:
We’ve got a labor force of 5.2 million (Georgia is 8th in the U.S. in population, with 10.5 million)
We’re a draw for talent: Georgia is 8th in the nation for net migration (2010-17), with Atlanta as a Top 5 large market for millennials
The median age here is 36.2 – younger than the U.S. median of 37.7
Georgia has an especially strong talent pool in transportation and material moving (380,000 workers); production (315,000); and computer and mathematical occupations (nearly 150,000)
The state’s leading specialized skills workers include: avionics technicians, aircraft assemblers, tire builders, cooling and freezing equipment operators, food scientists
Georgia is also home to 52,000 software developers and programmers; 21,000 computer and information analysts; 44,000 engineers (6,000 industrial, 5,000 electrical, 2,500 aerospace)
Each year, colleges and universities located within 250 miles of Atlanta produce an astounding 1 million new graduates (earning a bachelor’s degree or higher).





 









 
Whatever your business does, Quick Start will teach Georgians how to do it well. 












The No. 1 workforce training program in the U.S.


No state does more than Georgia to ensure workers meet the needs of companies in Georgia — and our program, Georgia Quick Start, has the No. 1 ranking to prove it. Georgia Quick Start has trained more than 1 million employees. Each training regimen is designed around the unique needs of each employer. The training is an in-kind, discretionary incentive to eligible, job-creating businesses in the state. 
Founded 40+ years ago – making it the first program of its kind in the U.S. – Georgia Quick Start is evidence of our ongoing commitment to workforce training for growing businesses in the state. Georgia Quick Start has set the standard for workforce training across the nation: Our No. 1 ranking across all surveyed site selection professionals goes back a remarkable 8 consecutive years.
The Technical College System of Georgia provides the training for free, and because all materials are proprietary to your company, you’re free to use them for future in-house training. For businesses creating jobs or upgrading the skills of current employees in Georgia, it’s a win-win — better trained employees, higher productivity, zero cost to your bottom line.
Quick Start is also flexible: Targeted instruction and hands-on experience can be provided in classrooms, mobile labs or right on site at your business. The program has trained employees in assembling autos… manufacturing machine components… sorting peanuts… growing bacteria for vaccines… even making donuts.

“When going through the rigorous process of site selection, one of the things that attracted us to Georgia … was the availability of a skilled workforce. Georgia Quick Start was a big differentiator.” — Starbucks









Six specialized training centers worth knowing about


If you need workforce training in a few key areas, good news: Georgia has specialty centers across the state. They are:
Advanced manufacturing
Not far from the Port of Savannah, Georgia Quick Start will deliver customized training in the new Georgia Advanced Manufacturing Center, covering mechatronics, control systems, automation and robots, software, equipment and operation controls, and industrial technologies and networked wireless systems of sensors. The 48,000-sq.-ft. center will be networked with five of the state’s technical colleges in the region.
Aviation
Gulfstream and Savannah Technical College partner to train avionics technicians, and airframe and power plant mechanics at an aviation training center on the college’s campus. The 30,000-sq.-ft. center offers 4 labs and a 5,000-sq.-ft. hangar for hands-on learning.
Bioscience
Just east of Atlanta, in Stanton Springs, you’ll find the Georgia BioScience Training Center, which offers state-of-the-art technology used in the life sciences industry. The 40,000-sq.-ft., state-owned facility opened in 2015 with a customized program to support pharmaceuticals giant Shire (formerly Baxalta), which had recently opened a plasma fractionation plant. The center’s flexible design, however, can accommodate the bioscience manufacturing processes of other companies.
Cybersecurity
Several levels of cyber education, from certificate through graduate school, are available in Augusta at the Georgia Cyber Center. The center — as of 2019, the single largest state investment in a cybersecurity facility in the nation — is a hub for research, training, partnerships and startups. The center’s first building opened in July 2018.
Film
The highly acclaimed Georgia Film Academy supports the workforce needs of the state’s film industry. Courses are offered across the state through the University System of Georgia colleges and universities and the Technical College System of Georgia. Students gain professional training in film production, with credits applying toward 2- and 4-year degrees. The program also helps students network, build resumes and market themselves to work in the industry.
Fintech
The University System of Georgia is launching an online academy developed in partnership with fintech employers. Students at Georgia’s 26 public colleges and universities can take courses through the Georgia FinTech Academy through the system’s eCampus and cloud-based programs. The Academy allows learners to access the specialized educational experiences necessary to enter the fintech sector regardless of where they live in the state.





 

Georgia Cyber Security Training Center









Georgia graduates are versatile, diverse – and in great supply 


Each year, Georgia’s 85 accredited public and private universities award more than 132,000 degrees and certificates. These newly minted professionals continue to grow the state’s workforce and ensure a pipeline of qualified candidates for Georgia businesses.
Of course, education isn’t just about quantity, but quality — and Georgia scores high marks there, too.
According to the 2018 rankings published by U.S. News & World Report, Georgia is home to:
2 of the nation’s top 20 public universities (Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia);
2 of the nation’s top five HBCUs (Spelman College and Morehouse College).
1 of the nation’s top 20 business schools (Emory University’s Goizueta Business School);
So many of Georgia’s top high school students go to college here – because of HOPE
Georgiais a national leader in expanding access to college education, empowering the best and brightest young people from all walks of life. Georgia’s HOPE scholarship was the first merit-based state scholarship in the U.S. and continues to be one of the largest. The HOPE Grant provides tuition assistance to students pursuing a certificate or diploma. Since its launch in 1993, HOPE has provided more than $10 billion in scholarships and grants for 1.7 million of Georgia’s top students.
A separate HOPE Career Grant provides free-tuition training in 17 “high-demand” occupations through the Technical College System of Georgia. TCSG is where students pursue a 2-year degree or certificate.
Georgia also invests in its K-12 education system to strengthen the future workforce. Georgia’s public high school graduation rate has steadily increased over the years and is now nearly 82 percent. Educators attribute this success in part to an emphasis on career and technical education.
The state also has 43 charter school systems and has received national recognition for the Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science and Technology – ranked 31st in the nation by U.S. News and World Report. Other high-ranking schools are DeKalb School of the Arts (75th) and Columbus High School (105th). Niche.com ranks The Westminster Schools 10th in private K-12 schools in the U.S.; Pace Academy (71st); and the Paideia School (153rd).

Life in Georgia






Infrastructure
Georgia is No. 1 for U.S. distribution and supply chain hubs — and No. 2 for infrastructure and access to global markets (Area Development). Georgia also offers a robust rail and highway infrastructure. It’s home to the busiest airport in the world (Hartsfield-Jackson) and one of the busiest ports in the US (Port of Savannah), plus the intersection of two of the nation’s largest fiber-optic trunk routes.











Direct access to U.S. and global markets from the busiest airport in the world 


International distribution becomes significantly easier when your business is near the most traveled airport in the world. 2,700 flights arrive and depart each day from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), and the airport moves 100 million passengers and more than 650,000 metric tons of cargo annually.
Direct flights are available to 150 U.S. cities and 70 international cities in 50 countries. You can reach 80% of the U.S. market in a two-hour flight – or less. In 2018, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was named “most efficient” airport anywhere by the Air Transport Research Society – for the 15th year in a row.
The airport’s total cargo warehouse space is 1.3 million square feet. Plenty of service personnel are available at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to help send your products on their way — more than 100 licensed customs brokers, 200 freight forwarders and 100 trucking companies.

Savannah: the nation’s second-busiest container exporter


Deepwater ports in Savannah and Brunswick are Georgia businesses’ gateway to the globe and some of the busiest ports in the US.
The Port of Savannah is the largest single container terminal in North America and the second-busiest U.S. container port. It’s also the nation’s fastest-growing container exporter.
It’s simple to transport your products to and from the port:
A high-speed truck route runs directly from the terminal to I-95 (eastern seaboard) and I-16 (to Atlanta and beyond).
Georgia’s two Class I railroads, Norfolk Southern and CSX, are located on the terminal.
Overnight train service runs throughout Georgia and to four other states: Alabama, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina.
By truck, it’s just a four-hour drive from Savannah to Atlanta, Charlotte and Orlando.
The Port of Savannah is expected to complete a major expansion project by 2022. The expansion will deepen the river from 42 to 47 feet to accommodate larger New Panamax cargo ships, and save businesses an estimated $174 million per year.
The Port of Brunswick is No. 1 among busiest ports in the US for new auto imports. More than 30 manufacturers of auto and heavy equipment use this port to move cargo. Several of them use more than 500 acres to process imports and exports – and another 600 acres are available for expansion. All of this is a quick 2.5-mile drive from I-95 and U.S.-17. Additionally, Class I railroad lines Norfolk Southern and CSX are available at the terminal.
Exporters and importers can speed their freight to and from Georgia’s ports via Georgia’s two inland ports —one in the southern portion of the state, the other in the north. These inland gateways to Georgia’s deepwater ports provide an efficient option to an all-truck-dray to and from the ports for target markets.
Cordele Inland Port in southwest Georgia gives exporters and importers in southwest Georgia, southern Alabama and western Florida a direct 200-mile rail route from Cordele to Georgia’s ports on the Atlantic coast.
Appalachian Regional Port provides exclusive CSX rail service on a direct, 388-mile rail route between the Port of Savannah and companies in northwest Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.





Solve your supply chain challenges with faster, more efficient — and more cost effective — shipping routes 









80% of the U.S. market is less than 2 days away by land


Rated No. 3 in the nation for rail accessibility by Area Development Magazine, Georgia has one of the most extensive railway systems in the U.S.  
Georgia is served by both of the Eastern U.S. Class I railroads, CSX and Norfolk Southern, along with 24 short line railroads. These rail providers travel on 5,000 miles of track, moving nearly 200 million tons of cargo each year. By locating your business in Georgia, you gain access to more miles of rail than any other state in the Southeast.
Georgia’s railroads work hand-in-hand with our seaports, and the $126.7 million Mason Mega Rail Terminal Project now underway will improve the efficiency of both. The project will double the annual rail capacity of the Port of Savannah to 1 million container lifts. By 2020, the Port of Savannah will host the largest on-terminal rail facility in all of North America.
Georgia’s six U.S. interstates — 1,200 miles of highway — connect you to 80% of the country in two days or less of driving time.





Soon to be: North America's largest on-terminal rail facility









Access to the world’s fastest information networks


Get ultra-fast internet access in metro Atlanta, a key Southeast hub for fiber optic infrastructure. Two of the nation’s largest fiber optic trunk lines intersect in Atlanta, along with two major research lines (Internet2 and the National Lambda Rail). 
Atlanta also has the advantage of core interconnection points from nearly every international and domestic fiber provider. AT&T and Comcast offer gigabit internet service, and Google Fiber is coming soon. 
Atlanta’s fiber infrastructure is reliable, robust and easy to access, giving your business the competitive edge in high-tech and data-rich industries. 
 





A robust and reliable fiber optic infrastructure gives you that nano-second edge. 









The world’s largest cold storage network calls Georgia home


Georgia’s 80+ cold chain facilities provide a dependable infrastructure for moving your perishables and temperature-sensitive products. If cold storage is part of your infrastructure needs, consider:
Georgia offers the 8th largest refrigerated space capacity of any U.S. state, with 80+ cold chain facilities and more than 19.5 million square feet of cold storage.
The Port of Savannah offers more refrigerated container capacity than any other port terminal on the East Coast or Gulf Coast, enabling it to handle 40% of the nation’s containerized poultry exports.
Three out of the five top global companies for refrigerated warehousing are located in Georgia, and two are headquartered here — including Americold, the largest cold storage warehousing company in the world.
In 2013, logistics giant UPS opened a second cold chain facility in Georgia. At 35,000 sq. ft., it’s the company’s largest cold chain facility in the U.S., with technological innovations that make the facility more efficient and productive.

Infrastructure
Georgia is No. 1 for U.S. distribution and supply chain hubs — and No. 2 for infrastructure and access to global markets (Area Development). Georgia also offers a robust rail and highway infrastructure. It’s home to the busiest airport in the world (Hartsfield-Jackson) and one of the busiest ports in the US (Port of Savannah), plus the intersection of two of the nation’s largest fiber-optic trunk routes.











Direct access to U.S. and global markets from the busiest airport in the world 


International distribution becomes significantly easier when your business is near the most traveled airport in the world. 2,700 flights arrive and depart each day from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), and the airport moves 100 million passengers and more than 650,000 metric tons of cargo annually.
Direct flights are available to 150 U.S. cities and 70 international cities in 50 countries. You can reach 80% of the U.S. market in a two-hour flight – or less. In 2018, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was named “most efficient” airport anywhere by the Air Transport Research Society – for the 15th year in a row.
The airport’s total cargo warehouse space is 1.3 million square feet. Plenty of service personnel are available at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to help send your products on their way — more than 100 licensed customs brokers, 200 freight forwarders and 100 trucking companies.

Workforce & Education
From top-ranking colleges and universities to Georgia Quick Start — the No. 1 workforce development program in the country — Georgia invests in preparing talent. Locate or expand here, and you’ll find a versatile Georgia workforce that can meet a variety of needs. You’ll also be doing business in an employment-at-will and right-to-work state, with low unionization.











A pool of talent that runs deep


Georgia is where people want to work – especially young people. A few key metrics that define Georgia’s workforce:
We’ve got a labor force of 5.2 million (Georgia is 8th in the U.S. in population, with 10.5 million)
We’re a draw for talent: Georgia is 8th in the nation for net migration (2010-17), with Atlanta as a Top 5 large market for millennials
The median age here is 36.2 – younger than the U.S. median of 37.7
Georgia has an especially strong talent pool in transportation and material moving (380,000 workers); production (315,000); and computer and mathematical occupations (nearly 150,000)
The state’s leading specialized skills workers include: avionics technicians, aircraft assemblers, tire builders, cooling and freezing equipment operators, food scientists
Georgia is also home to 52,000 software developers and programmers; 21,000 computer and information analysts; 44,000 engineers (6,000 industrial, 5,000 electrical, 2,500 aerospace)
Each year, colleges and universities located within 250 miles of Atlanta produce an astounding 1 million new graduates (earning a bachelor’s degree or higher).





 









 
Whatever your business does, Quick Start will teach Georgians how to do it well. 












The No. 1 workforce training program in the U.S.


No state does more than Georgia to ensure workers meet the needs of companies in Georgia — and our program, Georgia Quick Start, has the No. 1 ranking to prove it. Georgia Quick Start has trained more than 1 million employees. Each training regimen is designed around the unique needs of each employer. The training is an in-kind, discretionary incentive to eligible, job-creating businesses in the state. 
Founded 40+ years ago – making it the first program of its kind in the U.S. – Georgia Quick Start is evidence of our ongoing commitment to workforce training for growing businesses in the state. Georgia Quick Start has set the standard for workforce training across the nation: Our No. 1 ranking across all surveyed site selection professionals goes back a remarkable 8 consecutive years.
The Technical College System of Georgia provides the training for free, and because all materials are proprietary to your company, you’re free to use them for future in-house training. For businesses creating jobs or upgrading the skills of current employees in Georgia, it’s a win-win — better trained employees, higher productivity, zero cost to your bottom line.
Quick Start is also flexible: Targeted instruction and hands-on experience can be provided in classrooms, mobile labs or right on site at your business. The program has trained employees in assembling autos… manufacturing machine components… sorting peanuts… growing bacteria for vaccines… even making donuts.

“When going through the rigorous process of site selection, one of the things that attracted us to Georgia … was the availability of a skilled workforce. Georgia Quick Start was a big differentiator.” — Starbucks









Six specialized training centers worth knowing about


If you need workforce training in a few key areas, good news: Georgia has specialty centers across the state. They are:
Advanced manufacturing
Not far from the Port of Savannah, Georgia Quick Start will deliver customized training in the new Georgia Advanced Manufacturing Center, covering mechatronics, control systems, automation and robots, software, equipment and operation controls, and industrial technologies and networked wireless systems of sensors. The 48,000-sq.-ft. center will be networked with five of the state’s technical colleges in the region.
Aviation
Gulfstream and Savannah Technical College partner to train avionics technicians, and airframe and power plant mechanics at an aviation training center on the college’s campus. The 30,000-sq.-ft. center offers 4 labs and a 5,000-sq.-ft. hangar for hands-on learning.
Bioscience
Just east of Atlanta, in Stanton Springs, you’ll find the Georgia BioScience Training Center, which offers state-of-the-art technology used in the life sciences industry. The 40,000-sq.-ft., state-owned facility opened in 2015 with a customized program to support pharmaceuticals giant Shire (formerly Baxalta), which had recently opened a plasma fractionation plant. The center’s flexible design, however, can accommodate the bioscience manufacturing processes of other companies.
Cybersecurity
Several levels of cyber education, from certificate through graduate school, are available in Augusta at the Georgia Cyber Center. The center — as of 2019, the single largest state investment in a cybersecurity facility in the nation — is a hub for research, training, partnerships and startups. The center’s first building opened in July 2018.
Film
The highly acclaimed Georgia Film Academy supports the workforce needs of the state’s film industry. Courses are offered across the state through the University System of Georgia colleges and universities and the Technical College System of Georgia. Students gain professional training in film production, with credits applying toward 2- and 4-year degrees. The program also helps students network, build resumes and market themselves to work in the industry.
Fintech
The University System of Georgia is launching an online academy developed in partnership with fintech employers. Students at Georgia’s 26 public colleges and universities can take courses through the Georgia FinTech Academy through the system’s eCampus and cloud-based programs. The Academy allows learners to access the specialized educational experiences necessary to enter the fintech sector regardless of where they live in the state.

Georgia graduates are versatile, diverse – and in great supply 


Each year, Georgia’s 85 accredited public and private universities award more than 132,000 degrees and certificates. These newly minted professionals continue to grow the state’s workforce and ensure a pipeline of qualified candidates for Georgia businesses.
Of course, education isn’t just about quantity, but quality — and Georgia scores high marks there, too.
According to the 2018 rankings published by U.S. News & World Report, Georgia is home to:
2 of the nation’s top 20 public universities (Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia);
2 of the nation’s top five HBCUs (Spelman College and Morehouse College).
1 of the nation’s top 20 business schools (Emory University’s Goizueta Business School);
So many of Georgia’s top high school students go to college here – because of HOPE
Georgiais a national leader in expanding access to college education, empowering the best and brightest young people from all walks of life. Georgia’s HOPE scholarship was the first merit-based state scholarship in the U.S. and continues to be one of the largest. The HOPE Grant provides tuition assistance to students pursuing a certificate or diploma. Since its launch in 1993, HOPE has provided more than $10 billion in scholarships and grants for 1.7 million of Georgia’s top students.
A separate HOPE Career Grant provides free-tuition training in 17 “high-demand” occupations through the Technical College System of Georgia. TCSG is where students pursue a 2-year degree or certificate.
Georgia also invests in its K-12 education system to strengthen the future workforce. Georgia’s public high school graduation rate has steadily increased over the years and is now nearly 82 percent. Educators attribute this success in part to an emphasis on career and technical education.
The state also has 43 charter school systems and has received national recognition for the Gwinnett School of Mathematics, Science and Technology – ranked 31st in the nation by U.S. News and World Report. Other high-ranking schools are DeKalb School of the Arts (75th) and Columbus High School (105th). Niche.com ranks The Westminster Schools 10th in private K-12 schools in the U.S.; Pace Academy (71st); and the Paideia School (153rd).

Infrastructure
Georgia is No. 1 for U.S. distribution and supply chain hubs — and No. 2 for infrastructure and access to global markets (Area Development). Georgia also offers a robust rail and highway infrastructure. It’s home to the busiest airport in the world (Hartsfield-Jackson) and one of the busiest ports in the US (Port of Savannah), plus the intersection of two of the nation’s largest fiber-optic trunk routes.











Direct access to U.S. and global markets from the busiest airport in the world 


International distribution becomes significantly easier when your business is near the most traveled airport in the world. 2,700 flights arrive and depart each day from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), and the airport moves 100 million passengers and more than 650,000 metric tons of cargo annually.
Direct flights are available to 150 U.S. cities and 70 international cities in 50 countries. You can reach 80% of the U.S. market in a two-hour flight – or less. In 2018, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was named “most efficient” airport anywhere by the Air Transport Research Society – for the 15th year in a row.
The airport’s total cargo warehouse space is 1.3 million square feet. Plenty of service personnel are available at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to help send your products on their way — more than 100 licensed customs brokers, 200 freight forwarders and 100 trucking companies.





70 international cities are a single flight away. 









Savannah: the nation’s second-busiest container exporter


Deepwater ports in Savannah and Brunswick are Georgia businesses’ gateway to the globe and some of the busiest ports in the US.
The Port of Savannah is the largest single container terminal in North America and the second-busiest U.S. container port. It’s also the nation’s fastest-growing container exporter.
It’s simple to transport your products to and from the port:
A high-speed truck route runs directly from the terminal to I-95 (eastern seaboard) and I-16 (to Atlanta and beyond).
Georgia’s two Class I railroads, Norfolk Southern and CSX, are located on the terminal.
Overnight train service runs throughout Georgia and to four other states: Alabama, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina.
By truck, it’s just a four-hour drive from Savannah to Atlanta, Charlotte and Orlando.
The Port of Savannah is expected to complete a major expansion project by 2022. The expansion will deepen the river from 42 to 47 feet to accommodate larger New Panamax cargo ships, and save businesses an estimated $174 million per year.
The Port of Brunswick is No. 1 among busiest ports in the US for new auto imports. More than 30 manufacturers of auto and heavy equipment use this port to move cargo. Several of them use more than 500 acres to process imports and exports – and another 600 acres are available for expansion. All of this is a quick 2.5-mile drive from I-95 and U.S.-17. Additionally, Class I railroad lines Norfolk Southern and CSX are available at the terminal.
Exporters and importers can speed their freight to and from Georgia’s ports via Georgia’s two inland ports —one in the southern portion of the state, the other in the north. These inland gateways to Georgia’s deepwater ports provide an efficient option to an all-truck-dray to and from the ports for target markets.
Cordele Inland Port in southwest Georgia gives exporters and importers in southwest Georgia, southern Alabama and western Florida a direct 200-mile rail route from Cordele to Georgia’s ports on the Atlantic coast.
Appalachian Regional Port provides exclusive CSX rail service on a direct, 388-mile rail route between the Port of Savannah and companies in northwest Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.





Solve your supply chain challenges with faster, more efficient — and more cost effective — shipping routes 









80% of the U.S. market is less than 2 days away by land


Rated No. 3 in the nation for rail accessibility by Area Development Magazine, Georgia has one of the most extensive railway systems in the U.S.  
Georgia is served by both of the Eastern U.S. Class I railroads, CSX and Norfolk Southern, along with 24 short line railroads. These rail providers travel on 5,000 miles of track, moving nearly 200 million tons of cargo each year. By locating your business in Georgia, you gain access to more miles of rail than any other state in the Southeast.
Georgia’s railroads work hand-in-hand with our seaports, and the $126.7 million Mason Mega Rail Terminal Project now underway will improve the efficiency of both. The project will double the annual rail capacity of the Port of Savannah to 1 million container lifts. By 2020, the Port of Savannah will host the largest on-terminal rail facility in all of North America.
Georgia’s six U.S. interstates — 1,200 miles of highway — connect you to 80% of the country in two days or less of driving time.





Soon to be: North America's largest on-terminal rail facility









Access to the world’s fastest information networks


Get ultra-fast internet access in metro Atlanta, a key Southeast hub for fiber optic infrastructure. Two of the nation’s largest fiber optic trunk lines intersect in Atlanta, along with two major research lines (Internet2 and the National Lambda Rail). 
Atlanta also has the advantage of core interconnection points from nearly every international and domestic fiber provider. AT&T and Comcast offer gigabit internet service, and Google Fiber is coming soon. 
Atlanta’s fiber infrastructure is reliable, robust and easy to access, giving your business the competitive edge in high-tech and data-rich industries. 
 





A robust and reliable fiber optic infrastructure gives you that nano-second edge. 









The world’s largest cold storage network calls Georgia home


Georgia’s 80+ cold chain facilities provide a dependable infrastructure for moving your perishables and temperature-sensitive products. If cold storage is part of your infrastructure needs, consider:
Georgia offers the 8th largest refrigerated space capacity of any U.S. state, with 80+ cold chain facilities and more than 19.5 million square feet of cold storage.
The Port of Savannah offers more refrigerated container capacity than any other port terminal on the East Coast or Gulf Coast, enabling it to handle 40% of the nation’s containerized poultry exports.
Three out of the five top global companies for refrigerated warehousing are located in Georgia, and two are headquartered here — including Americold, the largest cold storage warehousing company in the world.
In 2013, logistics giant UPS opened a second cold chain facility in Georgia. At 35,000 sq. ft., it’s the company’s largest cold chain facility in the U.S., with technological innovations that make the facility more efficient and productive. 





“We are pioneering cold chain technology here in Georgia.” 
 - David Quintilio, VP Operations, UPS Supply Chain Solutions
