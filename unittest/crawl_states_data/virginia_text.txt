Virginia has performance-based incentives for companies that locate or grow in the Commonwealth.



CoStar Group, Richmond










Incentives

Virginia’s incentive programs reduce the costs of opening or expanding a business facility, and we work enthusiastically to assist employers who choose to put down roots and grow in the Commonwealth. We view incentives as an investment in Virginia’s economic future and a business opportunity for both the Commonwealth and the company.

The Commonwealth of Virginia offers an array of discretionary incentives for competitive projects evaluating a Virginia location, providing financial inducements that make good fiscal sense for all parties.

Infrastructure Assistance
The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) and the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation (DRPT) offer several programs to assist localities in providing adequate infrastructure access for industrial and commercial projects. These programs are designed to assist Virginia localities in attracting companies that will create jobs and generate tax revenues within the locality.

Rail Industrial Access ProgramProvides funds to construct railroad tracks to new or substantially expanded industrial and commercial projects having a positive impact on economic development in Virginia

Recruitment & Training Incentives
Virginia offers financial assistance and training to companies that seek to attract and retain qualified employees in the Commonwealth.


Virginia Jobs Investment Program (VJIP)Provides services and funding to companies creating new jobs or implementing technological change to reduce human resource development costs for new companies, expanding companies, and companies retraining their employees






Regional & Local Assistance
A number of targeted incentive programs exist in designated regions of the Commonwealth and within individual localities to attract businesses and assist in their growth. These programs can be statutory or discretionary and may offer additional financing options in some areas of Virginia.


Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs)Allows businesses to defer paying U.S. Customs duties on imported goods held within the zones until the goods enter the United States for domestic consumption



Tobacco Region Opportunity Fund (TROF)Provides performance-based monetary grants and loans to localities in Virginia's tobacco-producing regions (34 counties and six cities in southern and southwestern Virginia)

Tax Incentives
Virginia offers stable, low-tax costs for companies, including the benefits of no franchise or net-worth tax, a modest sales tax with a broad range of exemptions, and a 6% corporate income tax rate, which has not changed since 1972. Aiding the stable tax environment in the Commonwealth is a toolbox of credits and exemptions that companies can claim on taxes ranging from the sales and use tax to the corporate income tax.
