WEDC approves tax credits for new Amazon facility in Oak Creek

WEDC approves tax credits for new Amazon facility in Oak Creek inwisconsincom2019-03-25T09:14:13-05:00March 25, 2019|Featured Home, News| 

Support for the $200 million project is expected to help create  1,500 jobs in Milwaukee County.
MADISON, WI. March 25, 2019 – The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) has approved awarding state income tax credits to support Amazon’s plans to build a 640,000-square-foot fulfillment center in Oak Creek—a project expected to create 1,500 jobs.
Amazon plans to build the $200 million facility in the Ryan Business Park at Ryan Road and I-94.
“I thank Amazon for its continued commitment to growing in Wisconsin,” said Mark R. Hogan, secretary and CEO of WEDC, the state’s lead economic development organization. “Amazon’s existing distribution center in Kenosha County, which opened in 2014, is a true Wisconsin success story, and the company’s decision to make another major investment in our state is a testament to Wisconsin’s strong business climate and outstanding workforce.”
WEDC is awarding the company with up to $7.5 million in tax credits for job creation and capital investment for any investments Amazon makes in Wisconsin. The actual amount of credits the company will receive is contingent upon the number of jobs created and the amount of capital investment the company makes through 2024.
All tax credits are “pay as you grow,” which means the company must create the jobs and invest the capital before it can receive any credits.
This catalytic project will be the first-of-its-kind robotics sorting center for Amazon. The newly constructed 640,000-square-foot fulfillment center will be the flagship facility and will represent the company’s largest investment in Wisconsin, both in terms of capital expenditures and in terms of new jobs.
The Amazon associates at the facility pick, pack and ship small items such as books, household items and toys, a process that will utilize Amazon Robotics technology. This high-end technology helps speed up order processing times and increasing fulfillment center storage capacity.
Local and regional officials applauded Amazon for its commitment to grow in the region.
“We’re delighted that one of the world’s most successful businesses has cast another vote of confidence in Wisconsin,” said Gale Klappa, co-chair of the Milwaukee 7 regional economic development organization and executive chairman of WEC Energy Group. “This significant investment by Amazon speaks to the competitiveness of our region for global companies and to the strong upward trajectory of our economy.”
In addition to the 1,500 jobs expected to be created by the company in Oak Creek, an economic modeling study estimates the project could indirectly generate 792 additional jobs in the region. Those 2,292 combined jobs would generate nearly $3 million in state income tax revenue annually.

City of Fond du Lac receives $90,000 state grant to support redevelopment of downtown historical building inwisconsincom2019-03-25T15:20:35-05:00March 26, 2019|News| 

WEDC investment to help fund renovation of building into tavern, apartments
MADISON, WI. March 26, 2019 – The City of Fond du Lac is receiving a $90,000 state grant to assist in the redevelopment of a vacant commercial building into The Livery Lofts, featuring an upscale tavern and residential lofts.
The Community Development Investment (CDI) Grant from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) will support the renovation of the building to improve the exterior façade and support the change from a fully commercial use to a mixed-use development.
“One of WEDC’s top priorities is to help communities invest in revitalizing their downtowns and enhance their business districts,” said Mark R. Hogan, secretary and CEO of WEDC, the state’s lead economic development organization. “The Livery Lofts project is the latest example of a positive and substantive local development happening in Fond du Lac and will serve as a foundation for future economic growth.”
“The redevelopment of 18 E. Division Street into the Livery Lofts demonstrates how a public-private partnership can take a vacant building, where few people saw its true potential, and give it new life that transforms it into a beautiful building that honors the downtown’s history,” said Dyann Benson, community development director for the City of Fond du Lac.
The building was originally built as a livery stable in 1880, and developer Sam Meyer plans to incorporate it into the design and decor of the building. Meyer has successfully completed several other historical restoration projects in downtown Fond du Lac including the State Farm Insurance and Red Brick Inn building, the German-American Savings Bank building and the Art Districts Loft building.
The redevelopment project will require significant renovation to support the change to a mixed-use development. The Livery Lofts will feature an upscale tavern on the first floor and market rate apartments on the second floor. An existing asphalt parking lot will also be redeveloped into a new outdoor dining area for the tavern.
“I’m thankful WEDC believed enough in this revitalization project to provide funding to make it happen,” said Sam Meyer. “Without the WEDC grant, this project wouldn’t have happened. This project transforms a vacant, blighted commercial building into residential lofts and an entertainment venue that will add to the character of Historic Downtown Fond du Lac.”
This project looks to build off the success of another nearby historical redevelopment project, the Hotel Retlaw. Both projects will have significant impact on the character and viability of the corridor, encouraging future development and more visitors to the downtown area. The Hotel Retlaw, which plans to open this spring, was supported by a $250,000 CDI Grant from WEDC in 2018, a project expected to create 147 jobs.
WEDC’s CDI Grant Program supports community development and redevelopment efforts, primarily in downtown areas. The matching grants are awarded based on the ability of applicants to demonstrate the economic impact of the proposed project, including public and private partnership development, financial need, and use of sustainable downtown development practices.
Since the program’s inception in 2013, WEDC has awarded more than $20 million in CDI Grants to 79 communities for projects expected to generate more than $280 million in capital investments statewide.

Wausau River District named 2019 Great American Main Street inwisconsincom2019-03-27T09:32:23-05:00March 27, 2019|Featured Home, News| 

MADISON, WI. March 27, 2019 – Wausau River District has been named a recipient of the 2019 Great American Main Street Award, which recognizes communities for their excellence in comprehensive, preservation-based commercial district revitalization.
“Wausau River District has set an example for communities across the country that are looking to cultivate sustainable, long-term revitalization in their downtown,” said National Main Street Center CEO and President Patrice Frey. “They have shown what’s possible if you invest in public spaces, expand partnerships and collaborations, diversify funding sources, and launch programs that respond to the needs of your community.”
Selected by a national jury of community development professionals and leaders in the fields of economic development and historic preservation, Wausau River District is being recognized for becoming an amenity-rich arts and culture destination with engaging public spaces and a booming local economy.
“Wausau River District has consistently been a leader in district revitalization,” said Errin Welty, downtown development account manager for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. “The strong focus on public-private partnership engagement has fostered an atmosphere of innovation and creativity. While the River District has always been an employment hub and shopping destination, it is increasingly attracting visitors and residents that appreciate the district’s ample dining, nightlife, and recreation amenities.”
Founded in 2002, Wausau River District has played an important role in advocating for new developments as well as redesigning wider and more walkable streets. These efforts, combined with more than $93 million in public investment and $26 million in private investment, has allowed the city to focus on developing unique public spaces and special events that showcase the character and natural beauty of the downtown area.
Wausau River District hosts 100 special downtown events each year, ranging from concerts to art fairs, drawing over 72,000 visitors annually.
“I’m beyond proud of our community’s focus on improving the quality of life for our residents, through the creation of public spaces, community events, expansion of walking/biking trails and the vast amount of cultural and historical offerings that make our downtown so vibrant any time of the year,” said Blake Opal-Wahoske, executive director of Wausau River District.
The selection criteria for the winning communities includes their overall strength of their Main Street Program, commitment to historic preservation, active involvement of the public and private sector and engagement of community members and local stakeholders in the downtown revitalization process.
Alberta Main Street in Portland, OR and Wheeling Heritage in Wheeling, WV were also recipients of the 2019 Great American Main Street Award.
Previous Wisconsin Main Street communities that also received the Great American Main Street Award include Sheboygan Falls (1995), Chippewa Falls (1996), La Crosse (2002), Green Bay (2009) and Beloit (2011).
